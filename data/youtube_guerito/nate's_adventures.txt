This language has an interesting history and it's really quite interesting. You can read more about it here: https://bit.ly/2HRaIIS

Arieh Smith (XiaoMa) is THE GUY who inspired me to learn Mandarin Chinese. He speaks incredible Chinese and makes super entertaining videos of himself and his friends surprising people with their incredible Mandarin.

How I ended up teaching Arieh Spanish is insane, extremely lucky, and it's crazy to think that we're now friends...

Thank you to Arieh for letting me help him learn Spanish, and for showing you that language learning is a process, not an event!

Larry is such an inspiration of mine. His mindset simply blows me away. It goes to show the true power of the human mind and spirit. To be able to speak 37+ languages fluently is an incredible feat, and Larry is changing the world one language at a time.

You can keep up with Larry and his amazing journey here: https://bit.ly/33Ywd3g

Larry Languageins is a 12 year old hyper hyper very very hyper polyglot so hyper wow. He was born and raised in rural Tokyo, Japan. He was able to learn 36 languages by the age of 1 1/2 weeks old but has been struggling learning basic spoken English for the past 15 years.

Some of Larry's favorite things are:

▪️Sugar free almond milk
▪️Underwater basket weaving
▪️Tickle fights

Join my friends XiaoMaNYC, Seabolt Speaks, Ivan and I on an incredible trip to Mexicali, Mexico. Mexicali is the capital of the Mexican state of Baja California and is home to the biggest chinatown in all of Mexico. In the early 20th century, a large amount of Chinese immigrants came to the Valley of Mexicali to work for the Colorado River Land Company which was developing irrigation in the region at the time. Many of the Chinese migrant workers settled in the town of Mexicali, and now over 100 years later, the presence of Chinese culture is still strongly felt in this Mexican border town. It's incredible to see the mixing of the Mexican and Chinese cultures, and this pueblo is home to over 300 Chinese restaurants!

In this video, watch my friend XiaoMa speak perfect Chinese with the locals and surprise them with his amazing Mandarin and Cantonese skills! Then enjoy my conversations in Spanish with the kind folks of this town, including a hilarious Chinese restaurant owner! Explore a hidden underground basement, which was built decades ago by Chinese citizens to use as warehouses, casinos, bars, and living spaces. Take in the beautiful artwork in ""El Callejón de La Chinesca"", an incredible alleyway full of beautiful murals which tell the story of Chinese immigrants in Mexico. Join Ivan in the kitchen as he cooks up Kung Pao Chicken in a local Chinese restaurant. Be amazed by the incredible ""Imperial Garden"", one of the fanciest Chinese restaurants I've ever seen! Get serenaded by the fun mariachis located in ""El Parque de Los Mariachis"". And finally, say goodbye as we end our trip in the never ending sand dunes of Calexico. Thank you for watching, you're awesome :) New videos every Monday.

I speak a more Mexican Spanish so maybe I'm a little biased... 🤷‍♂️ But I think Mexican Spanish is THE BEST!!! There are so many fun, funny, and interesting words used in Mexico. I also love the Mexican Spanish accent and it's one of the easier Spanish accents to understand. Mexican Spanish for the win!

A lot of you have been asking me how to learn Spanish! I figured the best way to teach you was through a fun reggaeton song. This is the How To Learn Spanish Official Music Video!

Here is how to learn Spanish:
1.) Start speaking Spanish as soon as possible. Find someone who speaks Spanish and English well and practice with them EVERY DAY. This is how to learn Spanish fast.
2.) Be able to fail often. When you start speaking Spanish, you will fail a lot! The only way to improve your Spanish is to keep failing and learning from your failures, not getting discouraged by them.
3.) Listen. Listening to Spanish is SO IMPORTANT. It makes your listening comprehension much better and improves your accent a ton. (You can listen to my personal playlist of all my favorite songs in Spanish here: https://spoti.fi/3c0VM47)
4.) Be consistent. Start off with great small habits and grow from there. It's better to be consistent with small habits than burn yourself out with more than you can do consistently.
5.) Have fun. Studying Spanish sentence structure or grammar may not always be the most fun, but remember why you're learning Spanish in the first place. It will be so cool when you can meet over 500,000,000 new people just because you speak Spanish!

What are you waiting for? Get started! ¡Vámonos!

Thank you for watching, you're awesome :)

I've been learning and improving my Spanish for the past seven years. In the last year my Spanish has improved to the point where now native speakers will often confuse me as a Mexican! It's a huge accomplishment and I'm really proud of my level of Spanish. It's the most fun feeling when you're a gringo but can connect with Spanish speakers on a deeper level just because you speak Spanish.

In today's video I travel all around Mexico eating some of the best Mexican food that Mexico has to offer. We start off our food tour in Guadalajara, located in the state of Jalisco. Known for its incredible ""tortas ahogadas"", a thick sandwich drenched in salsa. Experience the delicious variety of pozoles and sopes we tried. Not only that, but we dive into sweets like Mexican Coke, jericalla (like a flan), and cheesecake!

Then we take our food tour to San José de Gracia located in the state of Aguascalientes. I try a ""duro preparado"" for the first time, a large fried piece of flaky dough made into the shape of a dish. Filled with cueritos, avocado, sour cream, lettuce, and salsa, it will satisfy your savory craving easily.

After that we're off to the small town of Mechoacanejo located in the state of Jalisco. We enjoy the refreshing ""raspados"" made by the local street vendor. Freshly made, they're one of my new favorite antojitos to have while in Mexico. Refreshing, sweet, and yummy. I ordered the coconut flavored syrup, (so delicious and full of fresh coconut pieces) but you have a wide variety of flavors to choose from. Did I mention he makes all of the raspado syrups himself?

Next our Mexican food tour is back in the heart of Mexico. We enjoy an amazing family barbecue in Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes. We had various cuts of meat, from think flank steaks to juicy sausages. Accompanied with flavorful rice, guacamole, and a chilis filled with cheese, it made for the perfect afternoon barbecue.

We head back to Guadalajara for some delicious sea food. Crab, tuna empanadas, and tacos de chorizo and queso. We celebrate the twins birthday with these mouth watering treats and I learn about Mexican ketchup.

Finally we end our extensive food tour at a ""birreria"" in San Francisco de los Romo located in Aguascalientes. I enjoyed gorditas full of rajas, potatoes and cheese while the rest of the group devoured ""birria"". Birria is extremely popular in Mexico and is full of flavor. Normally made with lamb meat, it's a stew eaten with tortillas and/or tostadas. Watch me try a tortilla with nothing else except salsa, a common Mexican snack.

Thank you for watching, you're awesome :) New videos every Monday.

Join me on a boat ride to look at the ""Broken Christ"", an incredible sculpture of Jesus with only one leg. Experience the incredible food in this area and see what it's like to party in this state!

In today's video I speak with Cesar @Spanish Language Coach  and I tell him what the typical stereotype of Spaniards is in the United States. It was funny for him to hear what the typical stereotypes are and it was interesting hearing his responses. Is is true that people in Spain always take siestas, eat fancy ham and dance lots of flamenco? Find out in this Spanish learning video!

10,000 subscribers! I'm so grateful for all the support you've shown on these videos. I started making videos when I was 7 or 8 years old, filming myself doing silly dances and songs on my parents computer. When I was about 10 I started making stop motions of Legos, then when I was in middle school I'd film myself on an old recorder playing video games.

High school is when everything changed, when I went on a hike with my best friend Chris and took my mom's camera to take some photos. I had so much fun I decided to save up and buy myself a camera. I got really interested in making videos and started making a bunch of funny videos with my friends. The last year of high school I told myself I'd start a successful YouTube channel and it's happening! The journey has been so fun and I'm hoping to continue on it for years to come.

I'm so humbled and want to thank you again for all the love.


Thank you for watching, you're awesome :)

This was my first time trying pupusas and WOW. Definitely one of my new favorite dishes from Latin America. The pupusa itself can be very heavy, but the curtido gives it a nice light and healthy flavor. Not what I was expecting! Now that you know how to make pupusas, are you going to?!

A huge thanks to Paulo for giving us a tour of his incredible house! This house has over 30 years of history to it, full of hidden gems. Paulo has been collecting interesting and weird items from all over Mexico and the United States for decades. We saw animals hanging on the ceiling, 10,000 Mexican pesos, and MUCH much more in his house! Enjoy this crazy house tour of arguably one of the coolest and most interesting houses in Mexico.

The journey to 50,000 subscribers on YouTube has been such a fun and exciting journey. I started my channel in high school when I was 17 years old. I would try and upload videos of my adventures twice a month. Eventually I began uploading less consistently when I started college. One day I thought it'd be fun to film some videos in Spanish because I'd never really done that before. The first Spanish teacher video I ever filmed is my most popular video to date with almost 3 million views! Your support has allowed me to create a life I had always dreamed of but never thought I could accomplish. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support and kindness.
