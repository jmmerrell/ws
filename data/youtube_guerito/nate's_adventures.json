Mexicali is the capital of the Mexican state of Baja California and is home to the biggest chinatown in all of Mexico. In the early 20th century, a large amount of Chinese immigrants came to the Valley of Mexicali to work for the Colorado River Land Company which was developing irrigation in the region at the time. Many of the Chinese migrant workers settled in the town of Mexicali, and now over 100 years later, the presence of Chinese culture is still strongly felt in this Mexican border town. It's incredible to see the mixing of the Mexican and Chinese cultures, and this pueblo is home to over 300 Chinese restaurants!\n\nIn this video, watch my friend XiaoMa speak perfect Chinese with the locals and surprise them with his amazing Mandarin and Cantonese skills! Then enjoy my conversations in Spanish with the kind folks of this town, including a hilarious Chinese restaurant owner! Explore a hidden underground basement, which was built decades ago by Chinese citizens to use as warehouses, casinos, bars, and living spaces. Take in the beautiful artwork in \"El Callej\u00f3n de La Chinesca\", an incredible alleyway full of beautiful murals which tell the story of Chinese immigrants in Mexico. Join Ivan in the kitchen as he cooks up Kung Pao Chicken in a local Chinese restaurant. Be amazed by the incredible \"Imperial Garden\", one of the fanciest Chinese restaurants I've ever seen! Get serenaded by the fun mariachis located in \"El Parque de Los Mariachis\". And finally, say goodbye as we end our trip in the never ending sand dunes of Calexico.

We start off our food tour in Guadalajara, located in the state of Jalisco. Known for its incredible \"tortas ahogadas\", a thick sandwich drenched in salsa. Experience the delicious variety of pozoles and sopes we tried. Not only that, but we dive into sweets like Mexican Coke, jericalla (like a flan), and cheesecake!\n\nThen we take our food tour to San Jos\u00e9 de Gracia located in the state of Aguascalientes. I try a \"duro preparado\" for the first time, a large fried piece of flaky dough made into the shape of a dish. Filled with cueritos, avocado, sour cream, lettuce, and salsa, it will satisfy your savory craving easily.\n\nAfter that we're off to the small town of Mechoacanejo located in the state of Jalisco. We enjoy the refreshing \"raspados\" made by the local street vendor. Freshly made, they're one of my new favorite antojitos to have while in Mexico. Refreshing, sweet, and yummy. I ordered the coconut flavored syrup, (so delicious and full of fresh coconut pieces) but you have a wide variety of flavors to choose from. Did I mention he makes all of the raspado syrups himself?\n\nNext our Mexican food tour is back in the heart of Mexico. We enjoy an amazing family barbecue in Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes. We had various cuts of meat, from think flank steaks to juicy sausages. Accompanied with flavorful rice, guacamole, and a chilis filled with cheese, it made for the perfect afternoon barbecue.\n\nWe head back to Guadalajara for some delicious sea food. Crab, tuna empanadas, and tacos de chorizo and queso. We celebrate the twins birthday with these mouth watering treats and I learn about Mexican ketchup.\n\nFinally we end our extensive food tour at a \"birreria\" in San Francisco de los Romo located in Aguascalientes. I enjoyed gorditas full of rajas, potatoes and cheese while the rest of the group devoured \"birria\". Birria is extremely popular in Mexico and is full of flavor. Normally made with lamb meat, it's a stew eaten with tortillas and/or tostadas. Watch me try a tortilla with nothing else except salsa, a common Mexican snack.\n\nThank you for watching, you're awesome :) New videos every Monday.\n\nIf you're new to the channel my name's Nate and I learned Spanish in high school. Learning Spanish has changed my life for the better. Now it's my goal to create videos that make you smile and inspire you to learn Spanish or another language! Love language.

In the last year my Spanish has improved to the point where now native speakers will often confuse me as a Mexican! It's a huge accomplishment and I'm really proud of my level of Spanish. It's the most fun feeling when you're a gringo but can connect with Spanish speakers on a deeper level just because you speak Spanish.

I'm so grateful for all the support you've shown on these videos. I started making videos when I was 7 or 8 years old, filming myself doing silly dances and songs on my parents computer. When I was about 10 I started making stop motions of Legos, then when I was in middle school I'd film myself on an old recorder playing video games.\n\nHigh school is when everything changed, when I went on a hike with my best friend Chris and took my mom's camera to take some photos. I had so much fun I decided to save up and buy myself a camera. I got really interested in making videos and started making a bunch of funny videos with my friends. The last year of high school I told myself I'd start a successful YouTube channel and it's happening! The journey has been so fun and I'm hoping to continue on it for years to come.\n\nI'm so humbled and want to thank you again for all the love.\n\n\nThank you for watching, you're awesome :)\n\nFOLLOW ME ON INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/natetecotzky/\nSUBSCRIBE! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE_krp5me5FBJYVnh-7yVUQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\n#learnspanish #10000subscribers #spanishvideos Hey there!

I'm so grateful for all the support you've shown on these videos. I started making videos when I was 7 or 8 years old, filming myself doing silly dances and songs on my parents computer. When I was about 10 I started making stop motions of Legos, then when I was in middle school I'd film myself on an old recorder playing video games.\n\nHigh school is when everything changed, when I went on a hike with my best friend Chris and took my mom's camera to take some photos. I had so much fun I decided to save up and buy myself a camera. I got really interested in making videos and started making a bunch of funny videos with my friends. The last year of high school I told myself I'd start a successful YouTube channel and it's happening! The journey has been so fun and I'm hoping to continue on it for years to come.\n\nI'm so humbled and want to thank you again for all the love.\n\n\nThank you for watching, you're awesome :)\n\nFOLLOW ME ON INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/natetecotzky/\nSUBSCRIBE! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE_krp5me5FBJYVnh-7yVUQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\n#learnspanish #10000subscribers #spanishvideos Hey there!

I figured the best way to teach you was through a fun reggaeton song. This is the How To Learn Spanish Official Music Video!\n\nHere is how to learn Spanish:\n1.) Start speaking Spanish as soon as possible. Find someone who speaks Spanish and English well and practice with them EVERY DAY. This is how to learn Spanish fast.\n2.) Be able to fail often. When you start speaking Spanish, you will fail a lot! The only way to improve your Spanish is to keep failing and learning from your failures, not getting discouraged by them.\n3.) Listen. Listening to Spanish is SO IMPORTANT. It makes your listening comprehension much better and improves your accent a ton. (You can listen to my personal playlist of all my favorite songs in Spanish here: https://spoti.fi/3c0VM47)\n4.) Be consistent. Start off with great small habits and grow from there. It's better to be consistent with small habits than burn yourself out with more than you can do consistently.\n5.) Have fun. Studying Spanish sentence structure or grammar may not always be the most fun, but remember why you're learning Spanish in the first place. It will be so cool when you can meet over 500,000,000 new people just because you speak Spanish!\n\nWhat are you waiting for? Get started! \u00a1V\u00e1monos!\n\nThank you for watching, you're awesome :)\n\nFOLLOW ME ON INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/natetecotzky/\nSUBSCRIBE! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE_krp5me5FBJYVnh-7yVUQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\n#howtolearnspanish #learnspanish #spanishsong Hey there!

I figured the best way to teach you was through a fun reggaeton song. This is the How To Learn Spanish Official Music Video!\n\nHere is how to learn Spanish:\n1.) Start speaking Spanish as soon as possible. Find someone who speaks Spanish and English well and practice with them EVERY DAY. This is how to learn Spanish fast.\n2.) Be able to fail often. When you start speaking Spanish, you will fail a lot! The only way to improve your Spanish is to keep failing and learning from your failures, not getting discouraged by them.\n3.) Listen. Listening to Spanish is SO IMPORTANT. It makes your listening comprehension much better and improves your accent a ton. (You can listen to my personal playlist of all my favorite songs in Spanish here: https://spoti.fi/3c0VM47)\n4.) Be consistent. Start off with great small habits and grow from there. It's better to be consistent with small habits than burn yourself out with more than you can do consistently.\n5.) Have fun. Studying Spanish sentence structure or grammar may not always be the most fun, but remember why you're learning Spanish in the first place. It will be so cool when you can meet over 500,000,000 new people just because you speak Spanish!\n\nWhat are you waiting for? Get started! \u00a1V\u00e1monos!\n\nThank you for watching, you're awesome :)\n\nFOLLOW ME ON INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/natetecotzky/\nSUBSCRIBE! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE_krp5me5FBJYVnh-7yVUQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\n#howtolearnspanish #learnspanish #spanishsong Hey there!
