If you enjoy what you see be sure to \"like\" and subscribe, there's a new video every week. If you want to see more, here's a playlist of me practicing Spanish with strangers! \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9G4IgrSODxZnl6DXEpJaeecLfrx3-K2q\n\nThe website I used isn\u2019t actually Omegle, its called Ome.tv. For language practicing purposes, I prefer it because there is access to more countries, fewer pervs, and a free app available on Android and iOS.\n\nSome of my FAVORITE Spanish learning sources are listed below \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\n\nGraded readers: \nTry them for FREE with a 30-day Kindle Unlimited Trial: https://amzn.to/2PCniiO\n\nShort Stories in Spanish for Beginners (Volume 1): https://amzn.to/2Kf5d8p\u200b \nShort Stories in Spanish for Beginners (Volume 2): https://amzn.to/3oIOitW\u200b\nShort Stories in Spanish for Intermediate Learners: https://amzn.to/35EdFFA\u200b\n\nSupplementary Sources:\nhttps://www.languagetransfer.org/complete-spanish\nhttps://www.duolingo.com/\nhttps://www.spanishdict.com/\n\nComplete programs:\nPimsleur Spanish: https://amzn.to/2OBcbqd\nBabbel: https://amzn.to/2PD5Ivm\nRosetta Stone: https://amzn.to/3u1we09\n\nPractice with native speakers:\nhttps://www.italki.com/\nhttps://www.tandem.net/\n\n\n\nIf you have any fun ideas you'd like to see me attempt, be sure to comment below!"
