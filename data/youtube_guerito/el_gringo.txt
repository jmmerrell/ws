Like I said in the video, I like to spike my motivation to learn before I sit down to complete a lesson. Listed below are just a few of my go-to channels right now.

Moses has probably forgotten more about language than I've ever learned. Usually his videos are from his perspective as he walks around town striking up conversation in 2-8 languages on any given day.
https://www.youtube.com/user/laoshu505000

This is Xiaoma, he speaks fluent Mandarin and has been learning other regional dialects lately. His videos usually feature him in Chinatown (NYC) asking all sorts of questions in English before cutting to seemingly perfect Chinese.
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLNoXf8gq6vhwsrYp-l0J-Q


I forgot to mention this channel in the video, but Chris is also a great source to follow, he has a really fun series in which he reviews Chinese celebrities speaking English.
