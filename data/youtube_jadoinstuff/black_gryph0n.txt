HELLO! DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!

It's currently 6:39am and my neck hurts. :-P
This video was a pain in the butt to make, and I probably won't make any money off of it, but as long as it isn't removed from YouTube, I'm hoping it'll draw some new viewers to the new album my brother and I are working on! In case you haven't seen it yet, here's a sample of one of the more relaxing tracks we're writing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25iRmsxWpa8

OH! Today was fun! I got to participate in a STEAM event at a school down in Rio Rico! I sang the National Anthem, flew my paramotor around for the students, and showed them an old Tesla Coil I built (along with answering questions about YouTube and stuff.) I was actually surprised how many of them knew who I was! It felt like a mini-convention (except I got to fly and shoot lightning bolts! XP) I don't have a video of that yet, but I DO have a video of a particularly awesome sunset flight I had a few weeks ago! Totally Nil wind day, so I could fly incredibly low without having to worry about rotor! Here's a clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQnc3lDfKxk

Anyway, I'm flying to Mississippi this coming Tuesday (March 5th) so keep an eye out for new music, and possible another Genre Switching Challenge! ;-)

I'm gonna go to sleep now... For twelve hours. 

NIGHTYNIGHT!

HELLO! DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!
Guess what time it is here?! (I guess that's a rhetorical question as you can't really answer it, and the answer will continue to change.. So I'll just tell you the time right now.) It's 6:36am! The sun is coming up! What a lovely day! Time for bed.

Srsly tho, I hope you like the video! I'm really bad at keeping up with what's popular in the music world, so I had to learn some new songs for this video, but it was worth it. These genre scrambled tracks are really fun to make!! Speaking of toast, I'm super hungry! I'm gonna heat up a Jimmy Dean Sausage Biscuit and eat it when I'm done typing this description! Mmmmmm...

OH HEY!! Wanna see something flippin' cute?! I recently ran across an old archive channel that Nate and I made ten years ago to preserve some of our favorite video memories! Back in 2007, we were SUPER into Parkour and we even made up a few of our own stunts! Here's a video of a 15-year-old Nate teaching us all how to do the ""Delta Flip"". OwO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNK8rrGNPXQ

Ok, you know what? I really should go to sleep, but before I do, which song mix up thingy was your favorite? How about least favorite? Did you agree with the Checks and X's Nate and I assigned? How many songs had you heard of before? (Ok, sorry. This isn't a survey. :-P) You don't have to answer all of these questions but it's nice to know what my DEDICATED viewers think of my content. It helps me make more of the stuff y'all wanna watch! :-)

I honestly can't believe we got this video done in time! We were writing and recording our album until about 5 days before I had to leave Mississippi for Hawaii.

HELLO! DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!

You GUYYYYS, I'm so tired!! I bit off more than I can chew this time! :-P
I'm currently sitting in a garage in Kauai, using an external monitor because my laptop monitor died. By the time you read this, I'll be on the beach shooting a music video at for ""His Story"" the musical. Later tonight, I'm doing a show and I'm gonna be honest with y'all... I don't remember the lyrics. I have about 4 songs to memorize between posting this video and doing the show! :-P

I wish you guys could come and see it, cause it's gonna be pretty cool, but since you can't, here's some of the music from His Story: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY_9PL_YbK8

Oh yes and ALSO also, if you want more easter eggs than just that since Easter is coming up, here are some bloopers and things I didn't want to cut from this video but had too because it would have been way too long otherwise... https://youtu.be/PlhoONSwb00

I hope you enjoy me and Nate's shanananananagins. We have a lot of fun! I honestly can't WAIT for him to get out of the Navy and for you to hear our new album! I think you're really gonna like it! (At least I hope so. :-P)

Nightynight!

This took longer than it should have... I think I got a little carried away with the characters and ended up doing a lot more than I had originally planned. Hope it doesn't drag on. I'm always worried about my videos being boring. Stupid is fine, cringy is fine, but boring? Unacceptable!

HELLO! DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!! Well, I'm up super late again! I'm always like two hours behind schedule with these things, but I'm never upset cause I'm usually just relieved that it's done. :-P

In case you were wondering, our families Lake Powell trip was AMAZING!! Way cooler than I expected and I was expecting a lot! The houseboat was wonderful, the scenery was amazing, and the water was (almost) perfect! (a bit on the cold side).

Nate and I jumped from as many cliffs as we could find. Gradually getting higher and higher until it started hurting... Then we dialed it back a bit. ^^; Here's one of the higher ones we jumped from: https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/35081027_10211609765667293_1730236513020542976_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0&_nc_eui2=AeEnTND3ntxMYEn_KZvphGv8Ce-roYaUo_0nlbQ4yG0ugMDI_EKcFCs6LCNi883zMquzx8BhvbRYCRW6DxfnazwdpMVgOs2IaucE8zQMgZbq-A&oh=c92bcf7588752645447f799f601b4faf&oe=5BACB743

OH! We also rented a Jetski and bought a tube. For those of you who don't know, Nate drives Jetski's as part of his job in the Navy, so he was very good at making it almost impossible to hold on. XP
Here's a video of him (successfully) throwing me off the tube on the last day of our trip: https://youtu.be/sqfewvRFfEg

I'll post some more pictures later, but I'm heading to Hawaii in a few days, then to South Dakota right after that (talk about transplant shock!) then finally to Baltimore for BronyCon! WOO!

How was your summer so far? Do anything fun? Anything planned for the 4th of July? (or any non-American summer holiday. :-P)

Talk soon!

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!

Guess what time it is for me as I write this? You're not going too? You think I'll just tell you? Well, you're right. It's 8:38am! Pulled an all-nighter to finish this video on time. Granted, I think it turned out pretty good, but I am EXHAUSTED!! I have no idea what to type, I'm punch drunk. I'm just rambling... Typing whatever pops into my head. Pomegranate Cheeseburger.

Anyway, I should probably rustle up an easter egg, eh? Oh, I have one! Here's a behind the scenes Claire filmed of me trying Post Malone with an electric massager. It worked surprisingly well! XD https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj4BVmwh3co

OH! I went sky-camping on a dry lake bed with a bunch of pilot friends and the perspective was INSANE! You literally can't tell if you're 100ft off the ground or 3,000ft! It all looks the same! Here are a few pictures I posted on my Twitter: https://twitter.com/BlackGryph0n/status/1313221757889777664?s=20
Claire was also there! She had her first solo on a paraglider! I towed her to about 80 feet, then brought her right back down but she was very excited!!

Ok, well I'd better take a 30-minute nap before I have to get up for breakfast. I have a huge recording session with Daniel Ingram tomorrow too... Hopefully, I can stay awake. XD

LOVE YOUUUU!!!

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!

Ok, so as usual it's 5:30am and I'm super tired, so what better time to write a YouTube Description?! ;-P

OH! I have to tell you guys about the last two weeks in LA!
First of all, I went to record a Christian album with an AWESOME family from Hawaii! They were very fun and talented and I had a blast doing that. As soon as the music comes out, I'll drop a link in the next DDR!

After that, I went to Jeff (ACRaceBest's) house and hung out until the wedding. It was BEAUTIFUL! I'm not a big fan of weddings, but this one was awesome! I totally ship Jeff and Sara! (Appropriate too, since they got married on a ship!)

OH! And the little guy from Pirates of the Caribbean was there, so that was interesting! XP

I also got an invite to eat at Club 33 in Disneyland (THANK'S ETHAN!!) so I brought Jeff and Sara, Stephen and Laura and Sara's sister, Hillary along. It was INCREDIBLE!!

Again, I'm not one who usually enjoys the ""finer things"" but man... I could get used to that. The food was the best I've ever had, the decor was the epitome of class and the plates and silverware were nice enough to steal! (which I didn't, but I wanted too...)

I definitely see what all the hype is about now...
(Unfortunately, there were no videos allowed so I can't give any link to that.)

I CAN, however, give a link to some chase cam footage of my last flight! (I'm sure you're sick of that by now, but I always film when I fly so it's usually all I have when the time comes to make an easter egg... ^^;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFQ_LvOWjVs

OK, I gotta go to sleep now... Happy Thanksgiving America! Hope it was deliciously thankful!

HELLO! DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!

Hey, hey! Guess what time it is right now?!
(well, not RIGHT now, but as I'm writing this...)
It's 7:26am! I'm watching the sunrise with puffy, tired eyes. :-P
It's worth it though, this video kicked my butt but I'm very happy with it!

Oh, and it's REALLY foggy here! That may be normal for you, but it's REALLY unusual in Arizona! We've had some crazy weather the past few weeks! First, it snowed (like five inches), then it got really hot and all the snow melted in a day, and now it's freezing cold and foggy! I love it (even if it's a bit freaky).

So guess what. My brother Nate (Baasik) and I are spending the whole month of March together and we're gonna finish our new album!! I'm SO excited!! We've both had such crazy schedules that I wasn't sure we'd ever get it done, but now it's finally gonna happen! I really hope my new audience likes original music...
Hey... Want a sample? ;-)

Ok, I'd better go to sleep now... Enjoy the new music!

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!

So, it's late and I'm sick, so I'm gonna keep this one short if you don't mind...
Besically, I caught a cold in Australia and the timing was pretty bad because I got it just before my concert at Alicon. Had to sing with no voice (which was terrible... so why am I giving you a link to it? Ugh... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD04Ugofy9M ).

Anyway, the con was great and I had a blast! But it didn't do my health any favors and since I had a 14-hour flight right after that, I got even sicker. Eventually, this lovely cold settled in my lungs and well, yeah... This is what I sound like after coughing for a week. :-P

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining or feeling sorry for myself! I can still breath and I'm alive, so life is good! Just thought I'd try to explain the situation in a bit more detail in case you were curious as to WHY I would make a video like this. :-P I have a goal to reach a million subscribers before the end of this year and if I'm gonna do that, I NEED to put out consistent content! At first, I was very worried about losing my voice for over a week, but when life gives you lemons, cough into a microphone for an hour and see what you can edit down! XP

Ok, I'm gonna go sleep in the shower.

XOXOXO (don't worry, it's not catching anymore)

HELLO! DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!

Oh man, I'm currently in a pickle! (a small pickle though... Like, a baby dill)
I'm exporting a draft of this video now but I have two versions... One that includes some extra footage in the beginning (the part where we explain what the challenge is) and one that just cuts right to the chase. I'm torn between two different trains of thought...

Train 1 - ""Everybody knows how this challenge works, it's pretty obvious what we're doing... It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that we're drawing an artist and a genre from two bowls and mixing them together. The explanation is 23 seconds long and is just dead weight before the music starts.""

Train 2 - ""It's not completely obvious why we're giving the songs a Check or an X if we don't say that we're gonna be judging them, nor does it explain our surprise at reading each other's notes. Also, the footage where we explain what's happening is pretty funny! I enjoy watching it and I'd like to think other people will too.""

Train 1 departed Stress Station at 2:30 am and is traveling at 84mph. Train 2 left Brainfart Blvd at 3:15am and is traveling at 62mph. The stations are 421 miles apart and the trains are heading towards each other on the same track... What time will it be when they collide?

Just kidding, don't do math. Math sucks.
What I REALLY wanna know is which train will win!
I guess all of you reading this already know which one won, 1 or 2, ;-P but I don't know yet and it's making me want ice cream... Wait.... I always want ice cream, nvmnd.


ANYWAY!!! Here's the extra footage I promised you in the White Frame Diaries! It pains me to cut it but most people come here for music, not to see me and Nate goofing off:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG984p6N3xQ&feature=youtu.be


Ok, well I'd better go... I've got a train to crash!

These are SOOOO much fun to make but they are SOOOOOOO much work (at least seven O's worth)! Nate and I filmed this over the weekend, then he popped off to Seattle and left me behind to edit the video... I guess that's fair though, I mean, he does produce ALL the music. It's always amazing to me how quickly he works!

HELLO! DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!

So, it's 5:08 am right now which means I wasn't QUITE as fast as I wanted to be, but that's ok. I was on the phone with Claire for two and a half hours and it was a great conversation so it was worth it. :-P (Ask her what it was about, I'm sure she'll lie to you. Oh, and while you're at it, maybe nag her to finish editing that vlog we did together in LA! ;-)
Anyway, the conversation was great, but I stepped on a freaking CACTUS SPINE AND IT WENT COMPLETELY THROUGH MY SHOE AND INTO MY FOOT AND I HONESTLY CAN'T TELL IF THERE IS STILL SOME SPINE IN THERE OR IF THE PAIN JUST COMES FROM THE FACT THAT, YOU KNOW, I HAVE A BIG FREAKING HOLE IN MY FOOT!! I'm sure it will be fine though. I don't need to walk.

Now let's see... I'm honestly not super sure what to do for an easter egg. I've been putting a bonus video link in every description for a few years now and I'm running out of interesting stuff. :-P I might just start posting links to YouTube videos that I enjoyed, would anybody mind that? Let's try it out. Here's a video I found recently that made me giggle for a few minutes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Jd9AmepgdM

Oh, and JUST IN CASE you want more of me and my bro, here's the video we sent to all the people who guessed the album name right last month! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcP6Hdom6g4&t

Ok, time to eat a cookie and then go to bed! NIGHTYNIGHT!!

HELLO! DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!
Dang, Hawaii was amazing as usual but this trip was particularly crazy! First, we stayed at Disney's Aulani Resort for the 4th of July to watch the fireworks: https://twitter.com/BlackGryph0n/status/1147053503220613120
Then we went to the north shore and stayed in a house on the beach. LOTS of snorkeling and LOTS of sunburn! I also rescued a juvenile sea turtle that was stranded in a tiny hot tidepool after the tide went out. I WON'T be showing you that video, however, as I don't want to get fined for touching a sea turtle. :-P Instead, here's a few clips of my favorite snorkeling spot in Oahu! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MgILjSgr0k

I also saw a Whitetip Reef Shark during the day which I wasn't expecting as they're mostly nocturnal. :-P I got a video of that too, but it's on my Dad's camera so I won't be able to post it until I get the camera from him. It'll probably be in the music video for our next single ""Let Down"" coming next Friday! :-D

Ok, it's 5:45am and I need to go to sleep because we're watching Spider-Man tomorrow and I wanna be alert so I can help him fight bad-guys in case he asks us to help him fight bad-guys.

Love y'all!

HELLO! DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!
Man, life is about to get pretty crazy for me. Lemme paint you a picture (this will also help me sort out my schedule.)
Next Wednesday (May 15th) I fly to Vancouver to work with Daniel Ingram on some stuff. Then he and I are driving to Seattle (with Nate) to attend the Everfree Northwest convention where we'll be debuting a few of the songs from our new album!
Then I'm off to Mississippi again to meet up with Nate, finalize our album, and help him prepare to get out of the Navy! After a few weeks I'm heading to ANOTHER convention in Minnesota (during that time, Nate will be driving to Tucson. Then I'm flying to Arizona to visit the family and get ready for our trip to Hawaii in July! After that, Nate and I will be driving to San Diago to do a show at a Christian Music Festival, then we're off to -REDACTED- which I'm REALLY excited about! ;-)
Then, as far as I know, I have some time off! Hopefully, I'll have time to upload videos during all that craziness!

OH! Speaking of craziness, wanna see me almost drown?
Hang on... I actually don't know if I should post that... How about me NOT drowning instead! Here's an old video of me and Nate snorkeling in Hawaii: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MgILjSgr0k
If that's too slow for you, here's a low-level flight that was a total blast! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmZdJIx6cmU
You MAAAY have already seen that, so here's the link to the new song Nate and I are working on:

If you've seen all three already, hats off to you! I don't even think I'VE seen all three! O_o

Ok, well I'd better go to sleep. I'm touring some autonomous mining equipment with my friend Dan in the morning, so I gotta get some rest. (Dan is the other pilot in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFQ_LvOWjVs )

THERE! Hopefully, four old easter eggs are as good as one new one! ^^;

Ok, so I really ended up rushing this one cause I had to catch a flight (then I missed it anyway).
The video is a little longer than I would have liked, but hopefully it won't be too boring for people. I guess we'll see! At any rate, I'm glad I (sorta) got it done on time.. :-P

HEEEY DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)

Well lemme tell ya, it'll be a miracle if this video is up on time! I have to go to the airport in like, ten minutes and the video JUST FINISHED exporting! O_O!!

EDIT: Ok, so I'm typing this at my Gate at Tuscon Int... Unfortunately, I missed my first flight, but it WASN'T entirely my fault... I'm bringing Nate's cat, Gipsy, back to him and she peed on the way to the airport so they wouldn't let her on the plane cause stink... Just got back from a ten minute clean up session in the men's bathroom. WOO! TRAVEL!

Anyway, I'm waiting for the video to finish uploading on the home computer so I can paste all the info into it. By the time it goes live, I'll be somewhere over Louisiana. Hope people like it!

EDIT: Currently at DFW, looks like it's gonna go live on time after all! WOO!

Let's see, easter egg.. Well, I don't really have time to upload one. Lemme think.
OH YEAH! Here's a thing I did for Hasbro just before BronyCon. They actually contacted my agent because they needed someone who could impersonate the singer from full house and they saw me do a singing impression video. Didn't know it was for MLP until I had booked the gig! XP Small world. Anyway, hope you get a kick out of it (if you haven't seen it yet)! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUjgre3geWk

Ok, I gotta get on my next flight. Hope you enjoy the video! See ya in a week or so when Nate and I do ""Genre Switching Challenge 2"". :-D

After watching and thoroughly enjoying Deadpool 2, I felt obligated to make this video but soon realised that it was gonna be a lot more difficult than I originally thought because I SUCK at these voices and I only had about a week to produce it before the Deadpool hype died down so I didn't have any time to practice. Ok, there's my excuse! I feel better now.

HELLO! DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!! OMG guys you won't believe it! It's only 3:00am right now!! Somehow I finished this ahead of schedule even though I just started working on it this Monday! Maybe I'm getting faster?

Ok, holy crap... I just heard a whisper outside my door, no joke. Should I open it?
I'm not going too.
It was probably just my sister but still... on the off chance it's a ghost I'm just gonna sit here in my room with my 1911...

Speaking of 1911s, yeah, the one in the video is real. It's a Smith & Wesson Tactical-E series, Full-Stainless edition with custom muzzle break, grips, and polish. It's a total tac-driver, too! I'd post a video of me shooting it, but YouTube is weird about that stuff now, sooo... You'll just have to take my word for it.

Oh, by the way, my brother is coming to Arizona next week! We're gonna finish a new song we've been working on, and then we're all going to Lake Powell for four days on a houseboat Nate and I rented for the family! It's gonna be AWESOME!! I'll take pics and videos but you know how bad I am at vlogging. :-P I'll definitely post some highlights on Twitter, though!

Dang it... I'm running out of easter eggs. ^^;
Ok, here's something. Do any of you remember the April Fools video we released on April 1st a few years ago called ""TROOPA""? And we had all those cameos from Tombstone and SaberSpark and ACRacebest and Claire Corlett, etc? Well, here's the video I sent to those participating so they could learn how to ""Shrug the Troopa"". and now you can too! :-P https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NZx6MUVST0

OK, I'm gonna lay awake and stare at the ceiling until 5:00am because I'm not used to going to bed this early on a Thursday night. XP

Love and stuff

This was a really fun video to make! I also did it in record time! Filmed on Wednesday, edited Thursday, uploaded Friday morning! Usually, I do a ton of research and practice the voices ahead of this, but this time I just pointed my camera, grabbed my fob, and filmed for about an hour until it was time for dinner. :-P Did you like it? If so, I'll do more videos like this in the future!

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!

Boy oh boy! What a night!
It's currently 4:46am, which is pretty early for me! I'm usually finishing my video at around 6:00am! I gotta go to bed kinda early tonight though because we're doing a HARRY POTTER Marathon this weekend! 4 movies a day!! O_O Should be fun!

Here's a mildly intriguing fact; I produced the creepy violin track for my Joker impression because I didn't want to get flagged, but I didn't feel like opening any music production software, so I downloaded a sustained violin note from YouTube, imported it into Premier, layered it about seven times and stretched the audio to mess with the pitch. I can honestly say that's the first time I've ever produced music in a video editing program. :-P

Anyway, I have an interesting easter egg for you this time! When I was filming the video, I told Claire (my offscreen associate) that I could do Daft Punks ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"" from memory and she didn't believe me, so I decided to show her. The camera was rolling, so here's a video of me proving that I had way too much spare time in my teenage years:

Ok, time to sleep so I can wake up so I can sleep again!

Goodniiiiiight!

This is my 5th take. Recorded in Audacity on my AT2020 mic, filmed on my Canon Vixia camera and synched up in Adobe Premiere. No tuning, or video cuts. (THIS ONE WAS REALLY HARD OT DO!!! I almost gave up, but I'm glad I stuck with it. Ended up having to do a bit of comping, unfortunately, but still no tuning or effects aside from compression and EQ. :-)

- -- --- ---- Lyrics ---- --- -- -

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh, (Any way the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me
(Galileo.) Galileo. (Galileo.) Galileo. Galileo Figaro magnifico
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!

Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows

HELLO DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!

I'm currently in LA working on a very cool project with some very cool people! There are some insanely talented people here! It's a bit intimidating, but also really fun and an exciting challenge. Rest assured I'll give y'all a link once this project comes out. :-)

I'm recording until next Wednesday, then I'm heading to Jeff and Sara (ACRaceBest and Toodle)'s wedding!! SOOO EXCITED!! I hope he vlogs it! XP

Let's see though... Easter egg... It's been hard to come up with them recently since I've been uploading so many videos! :-P
OOH! How about this old song by me, Nate and Silva Hound (I think I'm allowed to say that now...) It was a secret project that we did at a con once just to see if we could draw a crowd. Everybody wore Vendetta masks and we started playing this song. People seemed to like it, but I don't think anybody figured out it was us. I don't remember though, it's been a while: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOydXaIqEv8

OK, well I gotta go to sleep because I have a lot of work to do tomorrow. Hope you liked the video(s) and I'll see y'all later!!!

A lot of my plans have been thrown for a loop, but I wanted to get a video out to you guys so I filmed this video quickly on my iPhone.

HELLO! DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!

Ok, oh my, oh dear, I'm tired...

I really wanted to get a video out last week but things are not going super smoothly over here... I'd complain about it, but I know that many people are worse off than I am, so I'm just gonna say I'm thankful to be in good health. I don't know how many of you need to hear this but things are not always as bad as they seem... Yes, there is a ""new"" virus spreading around the world and it's extremely contagious, but it's most likely not going to kill you... The quarantine exists to keep it from spreading so quickly that it overwhelms hospitals. Of course the elderly and immunocompromised are at higher risk, but keep in mind they are ALWAYS at higher risk. From ANY infection. It's always a good practice to social distance/quarantine yourself if you know you're sick, ESPECIALLY from people who are more likely to get extremely ill from diseases that a person with a healthy immune system would have an easier time fighting off...

I'm not saying we shouldn't be responsible and do whatever we can to prevent the spread of COVID-19 before there is a vaccine available to the general public, but we can be smart and cautious without panicking... Being so scared that you rush to the doctor whenever you sneeze, or hoarding all the toilet paper and hand sanitizer is NOT helping. In fact, it's making things worse. Remember, we still have a lot to learn about this virus. The symptoms are very mild for most so that makes it easy to spread and difficult to detect, but it also means there are likely a lot more people infected than have been tested and, while that sounds scary, it would also mean that the death rate could be a lot lower than the current estimated 3%. (This is my opinion so take it with a grain of salt. The death rate could also be higher, or the same, I'm just trying to think about this optimistically because I don't believe constant pessimism is good for people's mental health. We are bombarded with enough negativity every single day, we KNOW the bad news. Why not introduce some levity and a positive spin? If you find yourself stressing out about this, stop reading updates for a while. Turn off the TV. Put your phone away. Obsessing over something you can't control doesn't fix anything, it only makes you more miserable.)

Obviously, we should take this seriously, but we also shouldn't freak out.. This is not a zombie apocalypse. Most of the people who get it will recover completely in under 10 days. If we continue to wash our hands and social distance when possible, we will get through this with minimal casualties. Stay smart. Stay positive. Stay hopeful. Don't panic. :-)

If you want to stay up to date on COVID-19 data without the sensationalism of mainstream and social media, here's a website that is updated daily: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ (add ""/country/us"" to the URL for US-specific numbers)

Ok, I gotta go to sleep or I'm gonna die of exhaustion before I even have a chance to GET sick...

I love you all!

~Gabe

Hey, hobo man Hey, Dapper Dan
You've both got your style
But Brother You're never fully dressed without a smile!

Your clothes may be Beau Brummelly
They stand out a mile --
But Brother You're never fully dressed without a smile!

Who cares what they're wearing
On Main Street Or Saville Row
It's what you wear from ear to ear
And not from head to toe That matters

So, Senator So, Janitor
So long for a while
Remember You're never fully dressed without a smile!

I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart
In my heart I have but one desire
And that one is you, no other will do

I've lost all ambition for worldly acclaim
I just want to be the one you love
And with your admission that you'd feel the same
I'll have reached the goal I'm dreaming of, believe me

I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart

HELLO DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!

Oh boy, there is a LOT going on right now! I'm currently in Tucson but I'm headed back to LA in the morning for a few meetings with Steve Oedekerk and his agents, then I'm off to Amsterdam for Hearth's Warming Con! Should be fun! I've never been to the Netherlands before!

Also... TOMORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY!! O_O I'm turning... 30... I can't believe it. I always thought 30-year-olds were old and it snuck up on me SO FAST! I guess I have to start hating modern music now... Oh wait, I already do.

BTW, Last weekend I was at the Arizona Flying Circus with my flying buddy Dan and my friend Marcy and it was INCREDIBLE!! I made a quick highlight reel if you're curious, check it out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtjCWufxR9E

OH YEAH! And one more thing before I try to take a quick nap... I got contacted by the Fine Bros yesterday and invited to be on YouTubers React!! It sounds like a total blast and I can't wait to do it!

Ok, I guess that's it... Thanks for always reading this far, DDR's. You make me happy. :-)

HELLO! DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!
I LIIIIIVE!! Man, I usually hate editing, but it's been really fun making this video! I miss doing stuff like this. Nate's in Seattle so obviously it's been pretty difficult making videos together lately, but last week I couldn't resist flying up to see him! We had a great time hanging out, hiking, writing new music, and jumping off of cliffs into water! I'm back in Arizona now though because... I'm house hunting. Yup. I'm looking to buy my first house! It's kinda scary, but also very exciting and a great way to invest! I've been saving a lot of money this year (since, you know, not much to spend it on) and I figured it was a good time to make a REAL investment. I'll keep you posted on the progress as the situation unfolds.

Oh, and I'm still planning to move to LA in case anybody was wondering. It just really doesn't make sense to do that now. I have been working on some pretty exciting LA-based projects though! One small positive side to this lockdown is that it's forcing the entertainment industry to be more comfortable with remote recording. Both Claire and I have been booking a lot of work lately. :-)

Ok, I guess I should probably drop you a link to a hidden video or something... I was planning on cutting the outtakes from this video into a nice easter egg, but it's currently 5:49am and I'm just now exporting the first draft of GSC6, so... I don't think that's going to happen tonight... or uh, this morning... I'll make it eventually. In the meantime, wanna see me get hit in the face with a water balloon in slow motion? OH GOOD! Here's the video my sister made for our 4th of July party invitation (the smexy Fil-Am is my sister's husband, JR ;-) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYH5Aw856fA

Ok, I need sleep before I forget who I am... Goodnight!

HELLO! DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!
Ok, WOW! This video was REALLY HARD TO MAKE! So, here's the deal. I was PLANNING on releasing this last week but when I got back from Everfree Northwest, I was greeted by a computer that wouldn't boot. Now, I'm not completely clueless when it comes to computers but I tried EVERY TRICK I know and I couldn't get it beyond the BIOS. Finally, I took it into a local computer repair shop thinking I had some damaged hardware or something, and I was informed that my OS (Windows 7) had basically eaten itself. The drive had to be completely wiped and a new OS installed! They went with Windows 10 so, not only did I need to reinstall all my software and create all my presets and templates from scratch, but I also had to learn a new operating system. I THOUGHT about filming a quick impression video on my iPhone, but I HAPPENED to drop it a few days prior and it broke! Good excuse to get an XS, but REALLY bad timing...

Anyway, I'm in Mississippipispsipsi with my brother now and the album is coming along GREAT! We're hoping to have the first single posted to YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music, iTunes, etc. in a few weeks! Definitely before the end of June! WOO!

OH! I also have a super secret, super cool project with a super cool dude in LA sometime this month! Details are fuzzy ATM and I signed an NDA so that's pretty much all I can say about it, but I can't wait for y'all to see it! Should be super cool!

HEY, want an easter egg? How about some highlight footage from this AWESOME flight me and my friend Dan did over the mountains near my neighborhood! This was one of the best PPG flights I've ever had!! We're on comms the whole time but I don't have his audio, so just pretend I'm talking to myself. :-P

Ok, that's all I have time for. The sun is rising so that's my cue to go to sleep. ;-P

Love youuuuuuu!

This video was a total BLAST to make! We really wanted a vlog-like vibe and we did it this way for a few reasons, but mainly because we wanted to give you guys an accurate snapshot of a day in our lives. We’re not rock stars and we’re not pretending to be. We have a small budget and we’re working out of a small home studio. We could have put some extra time and money into making a more “professional” looking music video, but honestly, that wouldn’t have really been an accurate representation of what we, or this album project are about. We’re really just trying to have fun and we want you to have fun with us!

I’m in LA right now, but I’ll be flying back to Mississippi tomorrow to start the next chapter of me and Nate’s career! We’re packing up his little house in Mississippi and hitting the road for Arizona! We’ll be shooting our next music video along the way and releasing our next single two weeks from now! Wish us luck and stay tuned!!

I've been around enough to know what I'm missing
But I dream of something more!
And I might be down to help them fight for a vision
If I knew what all the fighting was for

Cause you've got an endless list to twist when things aren't going your way
You've got 'em convinced the facts are fiction, different spin every day
I'm not gonna tell you what you're missing
You wouldn’t listen anyway
But now that I'm here I've got something to say...

This is the last chance to tell you that I'm not coming back 
It's, that last chance to prove that I am stronger than that
There isn't much that I can do, but I'm not falling for that
This is the last chance to tell you, the last chance to tell you that I...

I've come too far to let you mess with my vision
Cause we dream of something more!
They're not gonna hear you cause the truth is loud and soon somebody will listen
I hope you know what all the fighting was for

Cause I've got an endless list of gifts when things start going my way
You may be convinced that I can't win but I don’t care what you say
I not gonna stand for your so-called “Mission”
I don't believe it anyway
But now that I'm here I've got something to say

(CHORUS)

I'm not afraid of where I'm going
Cause I remember where I've been, Oh oh!
And I know soon somebody will listen
To the very last
Very last chance...

This is the last chance to tell you that I'm not coming back 
It's, that last chance to prove that I am stronger than that
This is the last chance to tell you that I'm not coming back 
It's, that last chance to prove that I am stronger than that
There isn't much that I can do, but I'm not falling for that
This is the last chance to tell you, the last chance to tell you that I...

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!!

Dang! The time has finally come! We're so excited! We shot this video in one day on my new iPhone XS (honestly just bought it for the camera quality. Can you BELIEVE how good it is?! No, they’re not paying me.) Anyway, I have to finish the thumbnail so here's a word from Nate!

Oh hey legendary DDRs. This is Nate (also known as Baasik to people who know me as Baasik). Gabe is working on the cover art for this video at the moment so I thought I'd write to you all and let you know what's going on. Not much. There you have it. But in all seriousness, I am out of the navy (as of this past Monday) and am packing up my little cottage in Mississippi to head out west. Gabe and I will be driving together in a 16' Budget truck with a golden Hyundai Elantra (hopefully) in tow. So if you see our caravan coming through your town, don't forget to give us a holler and maybe throw us a snack. We won't be stopping often because we have to get home in time for a vacation. Also, I'm not sure if I'll feel confident doing anything besides driving in a straight line in a truck this size. Anyway, the many adventures of Gabe and Nate will continue in the next music video for our next single. Good chatting with you. Now sit back, relax, and enjoy this incredible video of a drummer playing exactly what Jack Black is saying in this clip from School of Rock. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYnH58Ur3tA

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!

I really need to learn how to edit during the day, but so much happens during the day that I don't want to miss! It wouldn't be so bad if I didn't ALSO have to get up at 9:00am most mornings for business-related calls. Napping has become my friend. :-P

Not a lot has happened since the last DDR section I wrote since, you know, it's only been a week. We did have a pretty epic storm a few days ago! The wind was so bad it knocked over my Dad's Plumeria. He was able to stand it back up though and it doesn't seem to be damaged too badly.

Ok, here's an interesting-ish easter egg... Did any of you ever play Halo? It was one of my favorite games growing up and I uploaded this video messing around in Forge World almost 10 years ago! The weird thing is it feels both WAY longer than 10 years and WAY shorter! Interesting how time seems to speed up as we get older. I always thought it was because as you age, each year represents a smaller percentage of the total life you've lived, but now I think it has more to do with recalling less throughout the year as you get older. :-P
Anyway, here's the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkmnPXgE9J4

- -- --- ---- Lyrics ---- --- -- -


I got myself a notion
And one I know that you'll understand
To set the world in motion by reaching out for each other's hand
Maybe we'll discover
What we shoulda known all along
One way or another, together's where we both belong

If we listen to each other's heart
We'll find we're never too far apart
And maybe love is a reason why
For the first time ever, we're seein' it eye to eye

If a wall should come between us
Too high to climb, too hard to break through
I know that love will lead us
And find a way to bring me to you

If you're ever lonely then STOP!
You don't have to be!
After all it's only a beat away from you to me!

If we listen to each other's heart
We'll find we're never too far apart
And maybe love is a reason why
For the first time ever, we're seein' it eye to eye

AH HELLO AGAIN MY OLD DDR (Dedicated Description Reader) FRIENDS!

Sorry I've been quiet for a few weeks. I was in South Dakota helping Celebrate Church again. It's a ton of fun, but also a ton of work... I've come to the realization that I can't continue to visit for that long because even though they're paying me, I ultimately end up losing money because of all the things I have to skip. (and also it's just not fair to you guys for me to be gone that long! :-P)

Anyway, I hope this video tides y'all over until my next impression video or original song (whatever comes next)

Question: How many of you are gonna see me at BronyCon this weekend? I hope a lot of you! Tell me you're a DDR and I'll give you a hug! (unless you don't want one of course. :-P)

OH BTW! I recently got offered a sponsorship opportunity with the company that manages Audible, Blue Apron, Quidd, Crunchyroll and a bunch of others... Should I do it? I've always been a bit hesitant to put advertisements IN my videos, but I guess if it's at the end and I try to make them funny, it wouldn't be too bad, right?... Please lemme know what you think.

OH! Here's a fun easteregg. I couldn't decide between take 2 or 3 for this video since they both had good and bad parts (as usual) so I decided to upload 3 with the music and mic feed, and post 2 unlisted with nothing but camera audio! (literally just the video file uploaded straight from the card). It's kinda stupid and embarrassing, but you might get a kick out of it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxsHK4EdAeI&feature=youtu.be

OK, better get packing.. Flying to Baltimore in like, one hour. (though, by the time you read this, I'll already be there. Or dead if there's a plane crash. I'm hoping it's the first option.)

BIEEE!

HELLO! DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!

So, THIS was a fun video! Right? Did you like it? Do you have any ideas that you think will make it better? I know we have a bunch of ideas but I have no idea if we're even gonna make another video like this. People might hate it! It is pretty weird. XP
Anyway, it's only 2:57am right now which is SUPER early for me! O_O I'm probably gonna take a shower after I upload this video. Not because I need one, because I WANT one. It's relaxing, dang it.

Oh, BTW, I'm heading to LA this weekend to hang out with some friends and also to discuss a very cool project with a very cool person! I don't think I'm allowed to tell you about it yet, but I'll be posting updates VERY soon!

Ok, wait, I just checked and I AM allowed to tell you, so here you go!

I shot a VERY fun movie with legendary screenwriter/director Steve Oedekerk! He's a brilliant, hilarious, kind-hearted guy and it was an absolute blast working with him! He sent me the trailer yesterday and it's ridiculously, stupidly funny (to be expected from the guy behind Ace Ventura, Bruce Almighty, and Kung Pow)! I don't think I'm allowed to share the trailer yet, but I'm hoping to have it for y'all as soon as I get back from LA! WOOOO!

Oops, I lied again! I AM allowed to share it with y'all!
Here it is! I play 6 of the characters (one of which is in the trailer)! can you guess which one? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_XpOM667A&feature=youtu.be

Ok, SHAWAAA TIME!!!

Into the unknown
Into the unknown
Into the unknown

I can hear you but I won't
Some look for trouble while others don't
There's a thousand reasons I should go about my day
And ignore your whispers which I wish would go away, oh
Whoa

You're not a voice, you're just a ringing in my ear
And if I heard you, which I don't, I'm spoken for I fear
Everyone I've ever loved is here within these walls
I'm sorry, secret siren, but I'm blocking out your calls

I've had my adventure, I don't need something new
I'm afraid of what I'm risking if I follow you
Into the unknown
Into the unknown
Into the unknown

What do you want? 'Cause you've been keeping me awake
Are you here to distract me so I make a big mistake?
Or are you someone out there who's a little bit like me?
Who knows deep down I'm not where I'm meant to be?

Every day's a little harder as I feel your power grow
Don't you know there's part of me that longs to go
Into the unknown?
Into the unknown
Into the unknown

Whoa
Are you out there?
Do you know me?
Can you feel me?
Can you show me?

Where are you going? Don't leave me alone
How do I follow you
Into the unknown?

HELLO DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!
Oh boy, I really need an editor! I know I keep saying that, but I'm too picky to actually do it... Maybe one day but for the time being, I'll just keep doing it all myself and complaining about it. :-P

Anyway, I'd better start packing.. I'm heading to the Arizona Flying Circus tomorrow morning (I'll already be there by the time you read this). It's a pilots get together in the middle of nowhere and lemme tell ya... It's pretty crazy! Here's a highlight video made by my friend Dan. I think I show up in it a few times: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0tVRrTnYts

OH GUESS WHAT! I finally have an Anual Pass for Disney Land! WOO! I feel like I'm one step closer to living in LA (thanks Claire ^-^)! We also went on Rise of the Resistance and MAN was it cool! Such a unique experience! Even getting ON the ride was exciting! We had to get into the park before it opened and then refresh the app right at 8:00am to reserve our spot! The competition was fierce! So many people were trying to get their place that the app was freezing up. After about a minute we started hearing cheers from people who successfully reserved their spot. By the time the app registered our attempt, it was 8:01 and we were group 57!! We didn't get to ride until 3:30pm but the people who waited until 8:04 didn't get to ride at all...Here's a video of that chaos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMekcXzq2Fo

I did the math, there were about 30 people to a group and less than 100 groups were admitted that day. It had only been opened for 18 days so that means by the time we went on it, less than 60,000 people had been on that ride since the day it opened! I felt very exclusive! XP

Ok, well I'd better get to bed... I'm tired and I gotta wake up early to drive to Phoenix!

This is my 2nd take. Recorded in Audacity on my AT2020 mic, filmed on my Canon Vixia camera and synched up in Adobe Premiere. No tuning, or video cuts. (I tried something new with this one though, I took the audio in my first take and brought up the volume about 10% during the choruses to thicken the vocals a bit more. It's a cheap way to get a similar effect to the one on Adam's voice. I also recorded some quiet BG harmonies on certian parts. What do you guys think? Do you like it when I do a bit more production, or do you prefer the completely ""raw"" sound of just one vocal take? :-)

- -- --- ---- Lyrics ---- --- -- -

Spent 24 hours I need more hours with you
You spent the weekend getting even, ooh ooh
We spent the late nights making things right, between us
But now it's all good babe, roll that Backwood babe
And play me close

Cause girls like you 
Run 'round with guys like me
Till sundown
When I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
Girls like you
Love fun, well yeah me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah
I need a girl like you

I spent last night on the last flight to you
Took a whole day up trying to get way up, ooh ooh
We spent the daylight trying to make things right between us
And now it's all good baby, roll that Backwood baby
And play me close

Chorus

Maybe it's 6:45
Maybe I'm barely alive
Maybe you've taken my shit for the last time, yeah
Maybe I know that I'm drunk
Maybe I know you're the one
Maybe I'm thinking it's better if you drive

Chorus x2 (Or that Cradi B. cameo... If you prefer)

WELCOME TO THE END OF THE DESCRIPTION, DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!
So, I'm flying to Australia tomorrow morning for Alicon! (woo!) I haven't been there in five years, so I'm expecting it to be completely different! (jkjk) But seriously, I'm really looking forward to it, will I see any of you DDR's there? If so, you know the drill! Say you're a ""DDR"" and you get a hug! (unless you'd rather me not, then don't say you're a DDR I guess).

So I have a question. I wanna do at least two more impression videos before the end of the year. I'm thinking Super Smash Bros and maybe another singer impression video, but IDK... I toyed with the Idea of doing impressions of other YouTubers (and I still plan to do that) but my problem is... uh... I don't watch a lot of YouTube.. ^^; In fact, I don't listen to a lot of music either! I prefer to spend my time outside, so I'm usually a bit behind on Pop-culture stuffs... That's why I need you guyzezszss help! Tell me what the people WANT!! XP

Oh, one thing I AM excited to announce though! Nate and I wrote two new songs last month and we are pushing our way towards a new album (finally)! I know it took way too long, but the thing is, we didn't want to force it... (coughgettingstrongercough) We wanted it to happen naturally and be a project of passion, not something we felt obligated to create, so we've only been writing when we've felt inspired too (and when we have time). We're hoping this new album will be as fun and exciting as IMmortal was, and we hope you enjoy it as much as we do!!

Ok, but you're here for the easter egg tho, right? So here's something we did when we WEREN'T writing music... It took like, two hundred tries so when we finally got it, instead of playing it cool (like we planned) I kinda just lost it... ^^; Here ya go! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq8Pk9M3df4

Ok, I need to pack... And wash some clothes.. And take a shower.

SEE Y'ALL NEX TIIIIIME!!

It's about time I did a #HazbinHotel song! To be honest, I wasn't even sure if I was allowed to do this, since I'm the singing voice of #Alastor in the pilot, but Viv said she loved it, so I guess it's ok?...  Nate and I wrote this song in about 8 hours! It was one of those songs that kinda wrote itself! I showed up to his house at noon, and by 9:00pm we were wrapping up recording!

Dearly beloved,
For your entertainment, it's my pleasure to introduce to you Hell’s latest arrival
The equal-opportunity killer, Alastor!

Hello, it’s nice to meet you!
Can you tell me where I am?
I don’t know how I got here
But I think I’m starting to understand.
I don’t belong among the angles
And baby that’s just fine with me.
The things I did up there were high school
But now I’m going for my degree

Hey
Sorry but you just got in my way
I promise honey I can feel your pain
And maybe I enjoy just a little bit
Does that make me insane?
Haven’t been the same since I expired
Doesn’t mean that I plan to retire
And now I have the power to bathe all of you in entertaining fire!

- CHORUS -

Wait a minute, do I know you?
Weren’t an old pal of mine?
Departed from us far too early
But now we’re meeting a second time.
We used to have such fun together
And maybe you have what I need
But first I have one tiny question
Tell me, do you demons bleed?

- CHORUS -

Hey
Sorry but you just got in my way
I promise honey I can feel your pain
And maybe I enjoy just a little bit
Does that make me insane?
Haven’t been the same since I expired
Doesn’t mean that I plan to retire
And now I have the power to bathe all of you in entertaining fire!

Hey
Sorry but you just got in my way
I promise honey I can feel your pain
And maybe I enjoy just a little bit
Does that make me insane?

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!!

I really hope you like this song! IDK if you've ever watched Hazbin Hotel but it's basically a show about life in hell. This song is about the character Alastor, who is a very powerful demon. He was a DJ in the 1920's and ALSO a serial killer. I like to think that the power he has in hell is proportionate to the amount of unspeakable crimes he committed on earth, but IDK if that's canon. Anyway, this song takes place at the moment of his death on earth and subsequent arrival in hell. He quickly begins to accept his fate, come into his power, and he even meet's an old ""friend"" from earth. I'm sure Alastor's friend is happy to see him too!... ;-)

ANYWAY, enough about the song! I just got back from a week-long trip to LA for a super-secret thingy... I promise I'll give you more details when I can. It was pretty intense, but Claire and I had a blast in my off time! We met up with a bunch of friends, ate a bunch of food, and even went to Disney Land! We wanted to see the Avengers Campus but there was a four-hour line just to GET IN!! So we road the Incredicoaster, Sorin, and Cars instead.
Want an easter egg? Of course, you do! Here's a video of me and an old buddy hanging out in LA: https://youtu.be/z1WKhVVLlpY

OK, I GOTTA GO TO BED SO I CAN WAKE UP SO I CAN GO TO BED UNTIL I DIE!

Love you all!

Guessss what time it is?! CORRECT!! It's 6:50am!
I was supposed to get this video done a lot earlier but of COURSE, I got distracted talking on the phone until about 3:00am. Totally worth it though!
Anyway, I'm REALLY excited about tomorrow (er.. today?) because I'm taking Nate to a dry lake bed 60 miles from hear and teaching him how to FLY MY PARAMOTOR! WOOOOOOO!! (for those of you who might not know what a paramotor is, here's a video of me flying the mountain range near my house) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Koc_4NheTk

I'll be taking pics and vids of Nate's progress so keep an eye on my twitter if you're interested in seeing how that goes!

I actually went to that same lake bed last weekend and spent the night with a few pilot friends and we had an AMAZING time!! 
Here are some cool shots from that weekend!

- -- --- ---- Lyrics ---- --- -- -

When a humble bard
Graced a ride along
With Geralt of Rivia
Along came this song

From when the White Wolf fought
A silver-tongued devil
His army of elves
At his hooves did they revel

They came after me
With masterful deceit
Broke down my lute
And they kicked in my teeth

While the devil’s horns
Minced our tender meat
And so cried the Witcher
He can’t be bleat

Toss a coin to your Witcher
O’ Valley of Plenty
O’ Valley of Plenty
Toss a coin to Your Witcher
O’ Valley of Plenty

At the edge of the world
Fight the mighty horde
That bashes and breaks you
And brings you to mourn

He thrust every elf
Far back on the shelf
High up on the mountain
From whence it came

He wiped out your pest
Got kicked in his chest
He’s a friend of humanity
So give him the rest

That’s my epic tale
Our champion prevailed
Defeated the villain
Now pour him some ale

Toss a coin to your Witcher
O’ Valley of Plenty
O’ Valley of Plenty
Toss a coin to your Witcher
And friend of humanity
(X2)

HELLO DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!
First video of 2020! Woo! Sooo, it's currently 7:56am and that's because I didn't start working on this video until midnight... In my defense though, a LOT has happened!!!
For one, New Years... It was AWESOME but it was also CRAZY!! It was 1920s themed (I guess a lot of people did that) and we had a BUNCH of people over! Claire Corlett came too! (Ask her how to crack a pecan shell, she can tell you all about it. XP) Here's a clip of the fireworks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzISm39EZfM
The party was awesome! But the craziest part was that my sister Zanna got ENGAGED!!! O0O
Sooo, the wedding is in March and we have a LOT to do to get ready for it!

In other news, my brother Nate (Baasik) decided he doesn't want to move to LA after all, but I am still planning to go so it's been kinda crazy lately trying to figure out what I'm going to do since I'll no longer be splitting rent with my brother... Anybody in LA looking for a roommate? :-3

Oh yeah, I had an AMAZING PPG flight a few days ago! Flew over a boneyard and got to see my dad's airplane (Boeing 747-400) super up close and personal! Check out this video by my buddy, Dan! (I'm the black, blue and green wing) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-n6h4lgleM&list=LLvzWGXYFDiiJ338KIJPhbhQ

I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals

I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive

I raise my flags, don my clothes
It's a revolution, I suppose
We'll paint it red to fit right in
Whoa

I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa

All systems go, the sun hasn't died
Deep in my bones, straight from inside

HELLO DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!

Wellll nowwww, this has been a busy few weeks! Lots of songwriting, but I'm happy to say that we are ALMOST done writing our album and oh boy... I'm REALLY excited about it! Like, not to be cocky but... It's really good. There are some songs that are honestly my favorite songs right now and we WROTE them! It's a weird feeling!

I hope you liked that sample of ""Last Chance""! It's probably gonna be our first release, and hopefully with a music video, but we'll see... We're prioritizing recording vocals over shooting video. (Of course, we may end up just doing videos like this: https://youtu.be/dsUe_kVBQaQ )
What do you think? Do you like the relaxed and super unprofessional vibe? I'll tell you this, it's certainly easier! XP

Oh, and as far as my monetization problems go... I chased it as long as I could, but I basically just got told ""the writers of every song you cover or parody own the original compositions and are therefore allowed to take as much money as they want"" which of course translates to all of it... Oh well. I'm still happy for all the new subscribers that came from my Genre Switching and Impression videos! Hopefully, new music and merch will make up for it. Also considering getting mechanical licenses and putting our covers on Spotify and iTunes. What do ya think of that? :-)

Ok, well I gotta go potty so I'm gonna run!

BIEEE

Dirty looks from your mother
Never seen you in a dress that color, no
It's a special occasion
Not invited but I'm glad I made it, Oh 

Let me apologize
I'll make up, make up, make up, make up for all those times
Your love, I don't wanna lose
I'm beggin', beggin', beginn', beggin', I'm begging you

Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around? 
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, can you come here please? 'Cause I want to be with you
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, can you come here please? 'Cause I want to be with you

Can we talk for a moment?
Got these feelings that I'm tired of holding on
Wasn't tryin' to get wasted
I needed more than three or four to say this, Oh

Let me apologize (yea)
I'll make up, make up, make up, make up for all those times (all those times)
Your love, I don't wanna lose
I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', I'm begging you
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, can you come here please? 'Cause I want to be with you
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, can you come here please? 'Cause I want to be with you

You say I'm just another bad guy
You say I've done a lot of things I can't undo
Before you tell me for the last time
I'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin' you

Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, can you come here please? 'Cause I want to be with you
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?

HELLO! DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!

OMGOSH YOU GUYS! I saved a tiny bat! I named him ""Pip"" because he is a Western Pipistrelle and he's the TINIEST WITTLE BAT I'VE EVER SEEEEEN! (which makes sense because Western Pipistrelle are the smallest bat species in North America). I was doing a show in Green Valley and found him just before curtain. They're typically hibernating this time of year, but this poor little guy was shivering on the ground behind the theater. Not sure how he got there. He must have fallen from his perch or maybe he hit the window during a daytime foraging run? I covered him with a napkin then did my show. When we were done, he was still there, so I took him home in a cup and did a mini-exam with a blunt bamboo skewer. He didn't seem to be injured, just cold, so let him warm up inside. When he was feeling a little better, I gave him some water and he became very curious! Grabbing the stick and climbing around on the counter. Eventually, I let him climb onto my hand and got some ADORABLE pictures! Have a look: https://twitter.com/BlackGryph0n/status/1088713522287005696

Anyway, I spent so much time helping the bat that I didn't get to editing my video until about 1:30am, so I'm VERY tired. Hopefully, I don't mess anything up. :-P

Ok, I think that's it for now. Sleep well if you're sleeping.
whatever, I'm gonna sleep so I don't care if it's right or not I'm too tired to think about it. :-P

Loveeezzzzz

~Gabe

HELLO! DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!

GOOOOOOD MORNING! (No, not Vietnam.)
Yes, that's correct, I've been up all night again. In fact, lately, I've been kinda nocturnal... It usually happens when I have a lot to work on. I always work better at night because there aren't as many distractions and I usually feel more focussed. Anyway, It's currently 7:47am (cool! I love jets!) and I'll probably be going to sleep in the next 30 minutes... Oh, that sounds niiice! ^-^

Anyway, I really hope you liked this video! It was kinda hard to make, but it was also a lot of fun! If it does well, I'll definitely be making more but I might not make them as long. My theory is that most people don't watch to the end anyway and it doesn't make much of a difference if the videos are shorter than 10 minutes (at least as far as my channel is concerned). If I made shorter videos I might be able to upload more often! Hmm.. I need an editor. Sorry, thinking out loud again. I'm glad I can type quickly. I used to hate writing in school because my thoughts moved so much faster than my pencil. I remember when I taught myself to type I actually started to enjoy writing! I still don't do it the right way but I'm fast enough that I don't care.

OH GUESS WHAT! I'm heading to LA again in a few weeks and there's a good chance I'll be meeting up with Roomie to do a video (and maybe a whole series! We haven't decided yet.) Looking forward to that as I've wanted to do more collabs this year.

Oh, you want an easter egg? Have you heard this cover of ""The Song Of The White Wolf"" that I did with Samuel Kim? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxFuQ6xRudw
I got to know him through my work with Daniel Ingram. He produces for Daniel a lot and he's super talented and cool! You should totally subscribe to him!

Ok.... I really need to sleep... I love you all! Thanks for your continued support!!

HELLO! DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!

TBH, I've been in a pretty frustrating situation lately... 8 of my top ten videos have been flagged for copyrighted content... (Including the new one with 18,000,000 views that I just uploaded last Friday.) This has been a MAJOR blow to my revenue and on top of that, I'm not even sure it's legal! Our Genre Switching videos and my impressions don't use any pre-recorded content and are only a few seconds long, so they should DEFINITELY fall under fair use as they both transformative AND parody, right?... But clearly, that doesn't matter to the people who flagged my videos because there's money to be had... I've tried disputing all the claims and they have all been denied with no reason given.

I've been pretty upset about it because this is a huge chunk of my livelihood and I put countless hours into making these videos, so to have them completely demonetized means that if I don't get this resolved or figure something out soon, I'm gonna have to stop doing this and get another job so I can pay my rent.

Anyway, if any of you have any ideas or connections who might be able to shed some light on a permanent solution, any suggestions would be very much appreciated! I love what I do and would REALLY love to continue doing it!

On the positive side, my new video has brought a lot of new people to my channel, so if you're one of them, WELCOME!! I hope you enjoy! Here's an easter egg! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmZdJIx6cmU (It's a clip from a very fun low-level flight. similar to my last easter egg, but uncut... I wanted to have something else for you guys, but alas, I must fight the demonetization demons... Wish me luck! See you soon!)

Thank you! I love you all!

When she was just a girl she expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep and dreamed of
Para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

When she was just a girl she expected the world
But it flew away from her reach and the bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear a waterfall
In the night the stormy night, she'll close her eyes
In the night the stormy night away she'd fly

And dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Ooooh
She'd dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Ooooh

La-la-la-la-la-la-la
And so lying underneath those stormy skies
She'd say, ""Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I know the sun must set to rise""

This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
Ooooh
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
Ooooh

HELLO DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!

I'm writing this in Mississippi but by the time you read this, I'll likely be in Minneapolis. Unless you're reading this on Monday, then I'm in LA working on a SECRET PROJECT, OOOH!!.. If it's Thursday, though, I'll likely be in Tucson.

HEY HEY HEY! I got to hang out with a bunch of wild animals yesterday! A friend of Nate's from church (fantastic drummer and great guy) invited us to visit his Mom's wild animal rescue and care center called ""Wild At Heart"" and because I had my Rabies shots, I was allowed to interact with Foxes, Possoms, Bobcats, Deer, and a surprisingly cuddly vulture named ""Roy""!
Here are some pictures and video of my favorite fox ""Dox"". Wish I could have spent more time with him! https://www.instagram.com/p/BynybtlAj9c/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link

And now for the FINAL easter egg...
As you may already know, we haven't released the name of the album yet and if you can guess the album name correctly before August 16th, you'll get a free download link! (Contest will be held on Instagram so we can DM the winners).
Anyway, since you were SO dedicated and read all the way to the end of this particularly long DDR, Here's a hint:

The name of this album is featured pretty heavily in a popular movie that was released last month!

OK, THAT'S IT! See you whenevertheheck

Remember me
Though I have to say goodbye
Remember me
Don't let it make you cry

For even if I'm far away I hold you in my heart
I sing a secret song to you each night we are apart

Remember me
Though I have to travel far
Remember me
Each time you hear a sad guitar

Know that I’m with you the only way that I can be
Until you’re in my arms again
Remember me

HELLO DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!
Ok, so a lot has happened in the last few weeks and I don't know where to begin!
Let's see... Ok, first off, I'm getting pretty close to 1,000,000 subs and I'm trying to figure out what to do for it! I thought about doing some kind of ribbon cutting in the air (I've already tested it with a roll of toilet paper at 2,000ft and it was pretty epic! Here's a video: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcMvHFw2cnM&feature=youtu.be ) 
I'm open to other ideas though! What do YOU think I should do for my 1M Sub Special?? Lemme know below! I try to read all the comments I get on a new video in the first few days, but just in case, put ""1MSubs"" in your comment so I can find them in a search! :-)

Oh yeah, also Cider Fest 2018 was a blast! Great convention, great people, and it's always fun to hang out with the Crebers and my other friends! During a random conversation with Tony Fleecs (comic book writer/artist extraordinaire) I found out that he used to live in Sioux Falls, South Dakota at the same time I did (back in the early 2000's) and he worked for the local news station that interviewed me when I got stuck on the rocks! (I already posted the video, but here it is again: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbcXuewoPEU&list=LLvzWGXYFDiiJ338KIJPhbhQ )
He probably wasn't there back when that happened, but he was DEFINITELY there and working when the city tried (and failed) to demolish an old feed tower! I was standing on the ground watching when this happened and apparently he was working on the coverage that this clip came from! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSxgaIZuy3g
Small world!

Oh, I also fell for the first time while trying to take off! There were a bunch of contributing factors: short runway, uneven terrain, weird rotor, slippery gravel surface, etc. I plowed into the ground head first at about 20 MPH... My helmet saved my head, but I bashed up both my knees and my left hand pretty good. The left knee has a pretty large laceration (3x1in), while the right knee is heavily bruised and feels lightly sprained... It's pretty interesting though because while I've had both of these types of injuries before, I don't think I've ever had them at the same time! It feels very interesting to walk and feel both external, and internal pain with each alternating step! I can't figure out which leg to limp on! XD


OK, that's it for now bububoos!

Catch ya on the flippity flop!

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!

Well, well, well… I've been awake for around 30hrs now. Oopsie! I am EXTREMELY picky with this video. But… now that it’s all over and uploaded a little *tardy*… I’m extremely proud of it! Yay! Isn’t that the whole point of these videos?! Of LIFE?!

My very long day started at 10:00am yesterday when the carpet lady showed up to my new, empty house to measure. I can’t wait to have a day where I can breathe so I can start to pick out some furniture! I think I might be hallucinating. Wow. I can’t wait to sleep. But then we’re celebrating my sister Zanna’s birthday this weekend. And tonight! Karaoke? I think yes! BUT THEN I also have to finish my MLP & Hazbin Hotel & Billy Bust Up signings. Whew. My eyelids feel like 90-pound explosives. Heh. Heh. That’s to do with Monday’s video where I did a bunch of cool things with the E.O.D. It’s gonna be a fuuuuun vlog! Alrighty, no more spoilers. Off to the cupboard-bed with me now, chip-friends!

Ok, there's ONE more spoiler... that ENTIRE DDR section was written by Claire because I was so busy editing. She emailed it to me and I decided to use it. She said, ""All I had to do was channel my inner Gabe""! Be honest, could you tell?

Oops. Almost forgot. Have an egg: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is5qnn2mjuM

Do I look lonely?
I see the shadows on my face
People have told me I don't look the same
Maybe I lost weight
I'm playing hooky with the best of the best
Put my heart on my chest so that you can see it, too
I'm walking the long road, watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress tingles my neck, how do I live?

The death of a bachelor
Oh oh
Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor
Oh oh
Seems so fitting for
Happily ever after (woo)
How could I ask for more?
A lifetime of laughter
At the expense of the death of a bachelor

I'm cutting my mind off
Feels like my heart is going to burst
Alone at a table for two and I just wanna be served
And when you think of me am I the best you've ever had?
Share one more drink with me, smile even though you're sad
I'm walking the long road, watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress tingles my neck, how do I live?

HELLO DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!

Ok, so guess what I've been doing lately? Did you guess learning how to tap dance? Cause you're WRONG! I've been watching Pokemon! Believe it or not, until about a week ago, I had literally never seen it before! Never played a game, never watched an episode. But I've been seeing a lot of Detective Pikachu commercials lately and I REALLY wanna see that (and actually understand what the heck is going on) so I started with the 2017 Pokemon Movie ""I Choose You"" and holy crap. I love it. I love it so much.
I think I'm hooked you guys. I can now name at least 50 pokemon and their evolutions. Should I be ashamed? Probably. Do I care? No. Anyway, do you have a favorite pokemon? Can you guess mine? If you guess it right, I'll heart your comment! ;-)

OH YEAH! How do you like our new song ""What You Need""? It's one of about 5 I'm REALLY excited about! An absolute banger IMO! I know it's linked at the top of the description, but here it is again in case you haven't listened to the extended demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNAMgLLJSQ0&feature=youtu.be

ALSO, some of you may know I attend a yearly pilots gathering in the desert called the ""MoTown Flying Circus"". This year, I met a really cool and super nice guy named ""JT"" who did a little interview of me. Here's the vid if you're interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGZeZAoO1Ck

K, I gotta go do an audition now, so uh.. TTYL!

Thought I'd go back to basics for a bit. I also mean that literally as I'm hading to Baasik's house on Monday to write some new music and maybe, possibly, do another reversify? :-3

I've been tryna call
I’ve been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I’m going through withdrawals 
You don’t even have to do too much   
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

(I look around and)
Sin city’s cold and empty
No one’s around to judge me 
I can’t see clearly when you’re gone 

I said ohhhh I’m blinded by the lights 
No I can’t sleep until I feel your touch.
I said ohhhh I’m drowning in the night
Oh when I’m like this you’re the one I trust 
(Hey hey hey)

I’m running out of time 
Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby 

I said ohhhh I’m blinded by the lights 
No I can’t sleep until I feel your touch.
I said ohhhh I’m drowning in the night
Oh when I’m like this you’re the one I trust 
(Hey hey hey)

I’m just walkin' back to let you know
I could never say it on the phone
Will never let you go this time

I said ohhhh I’m blinded by the lights 
No I can’t sleep until I feel your touch
Hey, Hey, HEY!

I said ohhhh I’m blinded by the lights 
No I can’t sleep until I feel your touch

HELLO DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!
Man, I was hoping I wouldn't be up so late tonight because these kinds of videos take so little work, but nope... Turns out, I will find a way to nitpick every tiny little detail until it's 5:30am and I'm writing this description between four-second blinks. Heh.

Anyway, how are y'all holding up? I honestly can't believe how crazy this year has been. I was never one to worry about my mental health before, but lately.. wow. I just can't seem to get a grip on my life sometimes. It feels like everything is out of my control. Still, there are ways to combat that feeling of helplessness. When I'm overwhelmed, I find the best way for me to relax is to just take a break from media. All media. Sometimes I read a book, go outside, call a friend, go flying, MAYBE watch a movie I like (I guess that counts as media?) but after a while, even though all heck is breaking loose in the world around me, things in my little bubble seem to return to normal for a moment. In those moments, I feel the most like me. I highly recommend taking a break from media if the world starts to overwhelm you, or, at the very least, take a break from the news. I guarantee you, the world can survive without you knowing every single terrible thing that's going on all the time. Ask yourself, is it helping me to know these things? If the answer is no, then why do you feel like you need to know it? Humanity spent most of its existence without constantly being told about every tragedy the world over. Also, keep in mind that most News sources are run by multi-million/billion-dollar businesses. They make the most money by telling the most shocking stories, so odds are you're only being told about the very worst things that are happening. Things are almost never as bad as they seem.

Woo! Rambled a bit there. Sorry. Ok, here's an easter egg - I liked my 4th and 3rd take, but I ultimately decided on my 4th because I missed a few notes on take 3. If you wanna see what it's like COMPLETELY raw, as in, just the camera audio raw, no track, here's take three uploaded directly from my iPhone to YouTube: https://youtu.be/iscM6MHVUYA

Ok, I love this part! sleeeeeppppp. I love sleeping. Good night purple peoppleelelee

We go together
Better than birds of a feather, you and me
We change the weather, yeah
I'm feeling heat in December when you're 'round me

I've been dancing on top of cars and stumbling out of bars
I follow you through the dark, can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain, the tattoo inside my brain
And, baby, you know it's obvious

I'm a sucker for you
You say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly
I'm a sucker for you, yeah
Any road you take, you know that you'll find me
I'm a sucker for all the subliminal things
No one knows about you (about you) about you (about you)
And you're making the typical me break my typical rules
It's true, I'm a sucker for you, yeah

Don't complicate it (yeah)
'Cause I know you and you know everything about me
I can't remember (yeah)
All of the nights I don't remember
When you're 'round me (oh, yeah yeah)

HELLO DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!

Guess what?... I'M TIRED!! I know, crazy right?! It's currently 4:43 am as I'm typing this and it'll probably be another hour before I'm in bed, but it's worth it!

A few days ago, Nate and I got back from shooting a music video in Mexico. We went Jetskiing, Parasailing, and ATVing in under 24 hours and it was CRAZY!! Lots of fun but we're exhausted. We were gonna take a break but I didn't think it would be a good idea to ONLY put out original music for the next few weeks, so we made this Genre Switching cover. Fortunately, Hip-Hop is pretty easy to produce so it didn't take us very long. I hope you like it!

As many of you may know, we're performing songs from our new album (and selling CD's) at BronyCon in Baltimore on August 3rd! Our show is Saturday Night and we're REALLY looking forward to it!! We'll also be shooting a music video for our new song ""Better"" during the performance, so I really hope to see y'all there!

Ok, it's Easter Egg time! Lets seeeee, what haven't I posted yet...
OH YEAH!! Have you seen the MLP covers I've been doing with Daniel Ingram? We recorded a bunch of covers at his awesome home studio in Vancouver before driving down to attend Everfree Northwest in Seattle! Here's a particularly challenging one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvNTItLMSxs&list=LLvzWGXYFDiiJ338KIJPhbhQ

OH, LAST THING! After BronyCon we'll be making another #GenreSwitching challenge, so yay! I know a lot of you wanted that. :-)

Ok, well I'd better go to bed before I start shlipng ondud fodfjfaazzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

This is my 4th take. Recorded in Audacity on my AT2020 mic, filmed on my Canon Vixia camera and synched up in Adobe Premiere. No tuning, or video cuts. (I also recorded a few background harmonies to fill out the track a bit better. You guys said you liked that in my cover of ""Girls Like You"" so I did it again. :-)

- -- --- ---- Lyrics ---- --- -- -

I got a condo in Manhattan
Baby girl, what's hatnin'?
You and your butt invited
So gon' and get to clappin'

Go pop it for a player, pop-pop it for me
Turn around and drop it for a player, drop-drop it for me

I'll rent a beach house in Miami
Wake up with no jammies
Lobster tail for dinner
Julio, serve that scampi

You got it if you want it, got, got it if you want it
Said you got it if you want it, take my wallet if you want it, now

Jump in the Cadillac 
(Girl, let's put some miles on it)
Anything you want
(Just to put a smile on you)
You deserve it baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you

Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

I'm talkin' trips to Puerto Rico
Say the word and we go
You can be my fleeka
Girl, I'll be a fleeko, mamacita

I will never make a promise that I can't keep
I promise that your smile ain't gon' never leave

Shopping sprees in Paris
Everything twenty-four karats
Take a look in that mirror
Now tell me who's the fairest

Is it you? (is it you?) is it me? (is it me?)
Say it's us (say it's us) and I'll agree, baby

- Chorus -

Say you want a good time
Well here I am, baby, here I am, baby
Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me, tell me what's on your mind
What's on your mind
If you want it, girl, come and get it
All this is here for you
Tell me baby, tell me, tell me baby
What you tryna do

- Chorus -

WELCOME BACK TO THE END OF THE DESCRIPTION, DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!
It's currently 4:40am cuz dats jus how I rollll. (for the record, I wish I didn't roll like that sometimes, because it results in me being tired every weekend, but I realized that even when I film my videos a day early, I still end up working on them until around 5:00am on Friday morning because I'm a perfectionist who only quits when he's tired. :-P)

Oh, how many of y'all will I be seeing at Cider Fest next weekend? If you come see me, you know the drill. Mention you're a DDR and I'll give you a hug (if you want one that is... I'd offer you some free merch but my manager is in charge of that and I'm not sure how kindly she'd take to me giving away freebies... I'm gonna ask her anyway!)

Oh BTW, I did a fun project for a YouTuber when I was in Australia. It was the last thing I recorded before I lost my voice. I should have posted it in the description of my ""20 Sick Impressions"" video as it was a lot more relevant to that one, but I was sick... So I didn't think of it. :-P (I actually forgot to hit record a few times and ended up doing impressions to the wall for twenty minutes before I realized I wasn't recording... -_-)
Anyway, here's the clip! (there are mild swears in it, but I was just reading the script. :-P) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnC-DrxAL6I

Ok, time for me to sleeeeppppp..

Beata Maria
You know I am a righteous man, Of my virtue, I am justly proud
Beata Maria
You know I'm so much purer than the common, vulgar, weak, Licentious crowd 

Then tell me, Maria, why I see her dancing there
Why her smoldering eyes still scorch my soul 

I feel her, I see her
The sun caught in her raven hair is blazing in me out of all control 

Like fire! Hellfire! This fire in my skin
This burning desire is turning me to sin 

It's not my fault! I'm not to blame!
It is the gypsy girl, the witch who sent this flame 
It's not my fault if in God's plan 
He made the devil so much stronger than a man

Protect me, Maria
Don't let this siren cast her spell
Don't let her fire sear my flesh and bone
Destroy Esmeralda
And let her taste the fires of hell
Or else let her be mine and mine alone 

Hellfire! Dark fire
Now gypsy, it's your turn
Choose me or your pyre
Be mine or you will burn 

God have mercy on her 
God have mercy on me 
But she will be mine or she will burn!

HELLO DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!
YAY! It's 4:38am! Can I be honest with you? I'm getting kinda sick of doing covers... I mean, I originally started doing them because they were relatively easy and were a good way to keep uploading videos even if I got busy, but lately, I just haven't been motivated to do them...
That said, I actually have a BUNCH of ideas for new videos, I'm just not sure how well they'll be received. As much as I like singing, it feels like a job and I'd love to have fun on YouTube again! Reversify was fun! We're definitely gonna do more of those, but I wanna do a LOT of videos like that! Both with my brother, and solo!
Soooooo... If any of you have something you'd like to see me do, please let me know!! I'm DEFINITELY open to new ideas!

Oh BTW, I'm working on a massive collab with MrBeast and a bunch of others. I'll hopefully have it done by next friday so keep an eye out for that!
We're also just a few weeks away from Ciderfest which I'm SUPER looking forward too! I'm not going as a VIP this year so I won't be on a lot of panels or signing autographs, but I WILL be doing a show on Friday night and wandering around the convention center with my friends. If you see me, come say hi! :-)

OH YEAH! And in case you haven't seen it yet, here's the trailer for the ""Thumb Wars"" movie I'm in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_XpOM667A
I play 5 characters in this and it was an absolute BLAST to shoot! Steve Oedekerk is a brilliant and hilarious guy and I'm super glad to know him!

Oh, and if you've already seen the Thumb Wars trailer, here's a bitter-sweet ""growing up"" montage my awesome sister Susanna made for our family! (It's on my Dad's YouTube channel, so stop by and say hi! He'd love that!) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2hWkh5f10

There are times when you're so weak you can't go on
You're not alone
I've been there
And there are times when every shred of hope is gone
You're not alone
I've been there

But try to get up off the ground, cause it's gonna turn around
I know you can't be found
And the sky is falling down
But when the sun comes out, it's gonna get better
So even when the lights burn out
There's a lining in the clouds
And it's gonna get better
It's gonna get better!

It's gonna get better
So even when the lights burn out
There's a lining in the clouds
And it's gonna get better
It's gonna get better!

I can promise you the pain won't last forever
Because I know
I've been there
And I can promise you no matter what, you're treasured
Because I know
I've been there

It's time to get up off the ground, cause it's gonna turn around
I know you can't be found
And the sky is falling down
But when the sun comes out, it's gonna get better
So even when the lights burn out
There's a lining in the clouds
And it's gonna get better
It's gonna get better!

So call me when you're feeling down
Cause I'll always be around
And when the sun comes out
It's gonna get better
So even when the lights burn out
There's a lining in the clouds
And it's gonna get better
It's gonna get better
It's gonna get better
It's gonna get better
It's gonna get better

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!!
Guess what time it is for me? CORRECT! 6:07am!
I honestly thought this video wouldn't take me very long since the whole song was recorded at once, so no fishing for footage, right? Well... Turns out there were some very crucial parts that were either not filmed, fell on a crossfade from the broadcast, or I messed up the lyrics (twice) so I had to find a LOT of clips from other songs, then stretch them to fit... Also, there was a dude with an infinity gauntlet with his hand up for the whole show. And it looked awesome! It really did! But, uh, it kinda ruined a lot of shots because the glowing infinity stones were pretty distracting... So I actually had to mask out the stones, frame by frame, in two different shots. It was fun! Yeah, that's it! FUN! I'm still having fun! I'm not tired, it's just a state of mind. I'm thinking very clearly right now I'm not disy at all and I'm not giving up on punctuation and sentince structure and spelling because im tired I just don't feel like it right now ok I can do what I want don't judge.

ANYWAY, I didn't have time to export a mini-vlog, but fortunately for me, I didn't need to make one, because JEFF did! XD TADA!! https://youtu.be/XhDr_MxMl-o?t=639

OK, I know, that's cheating... I may have something laying around, lemme check...
OH YEAH, here's the spoon thing. I think I posted this before? but whatever, it was a long time ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq8Pk9M3df4

ANYWAY, Nate and I are working on Genre Switching Challenge 5 next, so woohoo! Back to the content that gets millions of views and doesn't make any money! XP

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!

It's currently 4:00am and I'm quite tired, but I'm still gonna write this description thingy for y'all because I love you! I do! It might not be very coherent though because I'm... very tired.
I'm not gonna proofread either so you'll get an unfiltered look into my brain at 4:00am. How exciting for you.
So let's see, what's been going on in my life lately?... Well, I've been trying to find a house to buy so I can invest some of my money and have my own place to live while the world slowly starts to return to normal (whatever that means). Problem is that it's been VERY difficult to find a place! I expected the market to be kinda slow considering everything going on, but I was quite wrong. Houses are selling like candy over here! They're literally on the market for a few days before they're gone! I thought about buying my own plot of land and building a house on it, but all the good plots have also been bought up... It's a conspiracy I tells ya... Mcdonalds is buying it. They have a massive expansion planned. McDonald's city. Where every restaurant is a McDonalds and all the retail workers, doctors, mechanics, and teachers dress like clowns. It's coming. Mark my words.

Ok... I should probably go to sleep. Before I go though, if you get a sec, please let me know what you think of videos like this. How can I improve them? I'm eager to know since this Song Association series is the first I have ever done that wasn't edited entirely by me. I want to put out more content or y'all but in order to do that, I'm gonna need to start hiring people (like my amazing editor) to help me.
Easter Egg? Right! Since me and Nate's super old music was teased, here's a video of Nate (Baasik) doing some magic tricks when he was 12. :-P https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XXeUizPJFg

Ok, sleeeep is what I must do. Goooodninghhgtnhg

(Thus saith the Lord x8
I send a pestilence and plague
Into your house, into your bed
Into your streams, into your streets
Into your drink, into your bread
Upon your cattle, on your sheep
Upon your oxen in your field
Into your dreams, into your sleep
Until you break, until you yield
I send the swarm, I send the horde
Thus saith the Lord)

- Moses:
Once I called you brother
Once I thought the chance
To make you laugh
Was all I ever wanted...

(I send the thunder from the sky
I send the fire raining down)

And even now I wish that God
Had chose another
Serving as your foe on his behalf
Is the last thing that I wanted...

(I send a hail of burning ice
On ev'ry field, on ev'ry town)

This was my home
All this pain and devastation
How it tortures me inside
All the innocent who suffer
From your stubbornness and pride...

(I send the locusts on a wind
Such as the world has never seen
On ev'ry leaf, on ev'ry stalk
Until there's nothing left of green
I send my scourge, I send my sword
Thus saith the Lord!)

- Ramesses:
You who I called brother
Why must you call down another blow?

(I send my scourge, I send my sword)

- Moses:
Let my people go
Thus saith the Lord
Thus saith the Lord

- Ramesses:
You who I called brother
How could you have come to hate me so?
Is this what you wanted?

(I send the swarm, I send the horde...)

Then let my heart be hardened
And never mind how high the cost may grow
This will still be so:
I will never let your people go...

Thus saith the Lord:
Thus saith the Lord:
I will not...
Let your (my) people go!

HELLO DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!
So, it's 5:32am right now and the sun is coming up! That's the only time I see the sunrise anymore, if I stay up all night... At least I have a good excuse though. XP
Anyhooo, how's quarantine been treating ya? I'm definitely getting sick of it, but I've been getting out occasionally (easier to do when you live in the middle of nowhere) and finding little ways to cope. Actually, I'm about to hit 4 million subscribers soon and I thought about doing a video showing different stupid things I've been doing to entertain myself during the lockdown. Any interest in seeing something like that? :-3
Also, I don't have a super new easter egg for you this time, but I DO have an older one... From when I was 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26xgrdOoLmw

Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way, out
But you never go away
So I guess I gotta stay now

Oh, I hope someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home

Walkin' out of town
Lookin' for a better place
Something's on my mind
Always in my headspace

- CHORUS -

Hello, welcome home

HELLO DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!
DANG IT! Ok, so I REALLY wanted to put the music video in the upper right corner (like I've been doing) but, thanks to a new SUPER clever algorithm, my videos are now getting blocked worldwide whenever I do that so... I guess YouTube has found one more way to make it difficult for creators to make content. yippie.

In other, happier news, I am like, 99% sure I'm gonna be buying a house by the end of march!! I'll keep you posted, but things are looking good! Last month I put an offer on a decently sized house on 4 acres but they went with a lower offer because they didn't wanna deal with a VA loan... I honestly didn't anticipate that as being a complication but, apparently, it is for some... So, like, if you're in the market for a house and are planning on using a VA loan, just keep that in mind. Free tip. You're welcome.

ANYWAY, this new house I'm looking at is SLIGHTLY bigger and about 5 miles closer to town, BUT it also has less land so I won't be able to take off and fly from my yard... which is a bummer. Gives me something to look forward to in my next house, though!

Oh, want an easter egg? Here's our first take of this song! It isn't very good which is why we did it again, but I thought you still might like to see it. This is about as raw as it gets. :-P

HELLO DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!
Ok, so THIS is different, eh? I was gonna do a cover of ""Into The Unknown"" from Frozen 2 but I just had NO motivation... I mean, I love the song, don't get me wrong! But it's a lot of work to memorize, dress up, and then sing it over and over again until I get a perfect take, and then to have it demonetized every single time is just... Kinda disheartening...
So I thought about it a while... I wanna put out videos more often but I've been so busy with outside projects lately that I just don't have time. Then I had an idea! This idea!
Anyway, I really hope you like it! If you do, it will certainly make my life easier, and I'll be able to put out content more often! Plus, it's really fun because I get to let more of my personality show as none of this is scripted! WOO!

OH HEY! BTW! Didja notice I'm in YouTube Rewind this year?! Weird... I got an email from them a few weeks ago, telling me that I had one of the most liked creator videos of 2019 and I was honestly very surprised! 3.5 million likes doesn't SEEM like that much, but I guess it is! I wonder if we can break that record next year... Hmmmmm....

Anyway, you probably want an easter egg, right? Ok, how about this!
My friend and flying buddy Dan Toborowski made a pretty awesome highlight reel of some of his more epic flights this year! I'm in a bunch of the clips (look for the green, blue, and black wing) Check it! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsTHsnM_R0I

Ok, well it's 5:59am and I need sleeeeeeppppp, so...

Can you feel it? There's something in the air.
life's not perfect, but right now I don't care 
I'm feeling pretty good today I just want to let you know.
A bit of magic in the air and it's everywhere I go.

I've been grinning ear to ear as if someone broke my dial.
I guess I really like the way my face feels when I smile.
No, I can't really tell you why I suppose you called my bluff
It's just the way that I feel today and I just can't get enough.

So move your feet, step to the beat,
And let the rhythm of the music take you down the street
Get on your feet, feel the beat,
And share the magic of the moment everybody needs.
(X2)

Jump up and dance!
If you feel it, let me see it.
And clap your hands!
As the beat is repeated.
(X2)

Can you feel it? There's something in the air!
It gives me courage to move like no ones there 
I'm feeling pretty good today, I just want to let you know.
A bit of music in my step and I've got to let it show.

I can't tell if this feeling is a decision that I've made
I told a joke in the mirror and baby it was worth the price I paied :-P
So get up! Stomp your feet and give the rhythm all you got!
I can't say it'll make your day but I'll bet it's worth a shot!

So move your feet, step to the beat,
And let the rhythm of the music take you down the street
Get on your feet, feel the beat,
And share the magic of the moment everybody needs.
(X2)

Jump up and dance!
If you feel it, let me see it.
And clap your hands!
As the beat is repeated, repeated, repeated, repeated....

HEWWO DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!

Oh mah gooness, I am so tired! XD Gotta get up early too so I'm trying to be a responsible little gryphon and go to sleep, but it's not working because my eylids hate me...

So something crazy happened today! I went flying early in the morning (because the afternoons have been way too windy) and after buzzing around for about half an hour, I noticed a cop car stopped in the middle of a back road near where I was flying...
(here's a pic: https://imgur.com/QLvKVbm )

It honestly would have been pretty easy to avoid him if I stayed low and landed in an isolated field for a while, but I decided it would be better to land nearby and see what he wanted.
I touched down in the dirt off the side of the road and after about a minute, three squad cars showed up!
They got out and the lead guy was all ""Hands where I can see them! Take off your jacket! Lift up your shirt! Turn around! Do you have a weapon?""
This annoyed me because I always fly well within the law and FAA regulation, but it's not the first time some ultra-sensitive superstitious citizen has called the cops on me... After a brief interrogation however, I was informed that this time it was actually the boarder patroll that called! Apparently there's a known drug dropping spot around where I was flying and they thought I was flying stuff over the boarder!

Once they saw taht I was a US Citizen and a veteran they were a lot less concerned and one of them was really curious about my machine! He said ""Have fun, man! I don't know that I could ever do that.""
I wanted to say, ""It's fun while you're up there, but sometimes the cops show up when you land"". :-P

I don't have time to post any video easter eggs right now, but hopefully that story will tide you over... Keep an eye on my Twitter and Instagram as I'll probably be posting pictures during our trip!

Cherrio! Cheerio daaaaaarling!

HELLO DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!
Sorry about the hiatus. I've been working on another ""One Guy, 24 Voices"" style video and was hoping to have it done by now, but that whole rabid bat thing got in the way...
For those of you who don't know what happened, here's the full story:

I was doing a show in Green Valley, AZ and I found a bat on the ground just before curtain. They're typically hibernating this time of year so, thinking it might be sick, I covered it with a napkin then did my show. When I was done, the bat was still there, so I took him home in a cup and did a mini-exam with a blunt bamboo skewer. He didn't seem to be injured at first, but upon closer inspection, I noticed that the index finger of his left-wing was broken. He was a Western Pipistrelle bat and while they hibernate during the winter, they often forage for food during the day so I figured he must have hit a window at the theater. He was behaving otherwise normally, so I gave him some water and let him climb onto my hand so I could get some pictures. Have a look: https://twitter.com/BlackGryph0n/status/1088713522287005696

The next day, I called Animal Rescue to see if they could help my injured bat. They said they would take him in and see what they could do. Unfortunately, since he had a broken wing, they had to put him down :-( and since I had touched the bat, they decided to test him for Rabies...

He tested positive...

SOOOOOOOOOO, the last few weeks have been fun! I went to the VA in Tucson where I got my first four out of seven shots. 1ML of Rabies Vaccine in my right arm and 10 FREAKING ML of vicious Immunoglobulin in the rest of my limbs! I almost passed out (like a flippen wimp) but that was nothing compared to how sore and wacked out I was the next day. Turns out, my body doesn't like being injected with dead rabies virus and someone else's plasma. I was pretty loopy for a bit, but eventually, it wore off. Just in time for me to go get another shot!! :-D I had my sixth shot in the series two days ago and I'll get my last one next Wednesday. Then, hopefully, I'll be immune to rabies for a while so I can hold as many rabid bats as I want! ;-P (I kid I kid.) Seriously though, the shots weren't fun... They may also be pretty expensive (upwards of $10,000) so I'm HOPING the VA will cover most of it... I guess I'll find out when the bill comes in. I may need to start a GoFundMe... ^^;

Now, I've been getting a LOT of flack for this. :-P People calling me stupid or asking me if I've ""learned my lesson"" so let me just say right now: I knew the risk when I held the bat. I was willing to take a 1 in 300 chance to help a bat in need and get a cute picture. I drew the short straw this time, but whenever you gamble you run the risk of losing. Most of the things I do for fun involve a bit of risk. I do what I can to mitigate that risk, but you can never guarantee you won't get hurt while doing something that is inherently dangerous. People have been telling me my entire life not to do things because they are ""dangerous"", or calling me stupid for enjoying things that seem unsafe. It's true, I do tend to enjoy ""extreme"" sports more than the average individual, but I'm not reckless. I always weigh the benefits against the potential negative outcome and if I feel the reward outweighs the risk, I'll do it. We're all going to die eventually. I could die any day. Is living in fear of the unknown and missing out on incredible experiences worth potentially buying me a few extra years? I don't think it is. That's my decision. You can think I'm crazy, but I'm enjoying my life and if I die one day from getting bitten by a snake or jumping out of an airplane, I won't regret the path I took to get there. :-)

Ok, rant over. I'm gonna sleep now before I die of exhaustion! XP

Goodnight everybatty!

~Gabe

I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

I'm in Toronto and I've got this view
But I might as well be in a hotel room, yeah
It doesn't matter 'cause I'm so consumed
Spending all my nights reading texts from you

Oh, I'm good at keepin' my distance
I know that you're the feelin' I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it
But everything means nothin' if I can't have you

CHORUS X2

I'm so sorry that my timing's off
But I can't move on if we're still gonna talk
Is it wrong for me to not want half?
I want all of you, all the strings attached

Oh, I'm good at keepin' my distance
I know that you're the feelin' I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it
But everything means nothin' if I can't have you

CHORUS X2

I'm trying to move on
Forget you, but I hold on
(Everything means nothing, Everything means nothing, babe)
I'm trying to move on
Forget you, but I hold on
Everything means nothing if I can't have you

CHORUS X2

HELLO DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!
I literally first heard this song about a day before I recorded it.. I'll probably hate this cover in a few weeks, once I learn the song better. That usually happens once I really memorize the song and start to notice the more subtle nuances in the voices and instrumentation. I can already hear one thing I wish I did differently... I'm singing ""about - you"" and Shawn sings it more like ""aboud-a-you"" assigning an extra note to the ""a"" that I omit when I sing with a space in between the ""about"" and the ""you"". Oh well, I'll do it better at Karaoke next time. :-P

So Nate and I were gonna try to do Genre Switching Challenge 5 this weekend, but we had to push it back for a few reasons, the coolest of which is that my friend Claire Corlett is here from LA! I Don't get to see her very often but we're pretty close so it's cool when I get too. :-) She's here for a little over a week to record an EP she's writing, and also to explore the desert. Gonna take her shooting tomorrow if it doesn't rain (don't worry, I'm not gonna kill Sweetie Belle).

Ok, now for an easter egg... OK, how about this, here's a video of Claire and I playing Ping Pong. Riveting, I know. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg8qM-c_v80

Ok, it's 6:08am and the sun is coming up, so that means it's time for bed!

G'nite

- -- --- ---- LYRICS ---- --- -- -

Tommy used to work on the docks, union's been on strike
He's down on his luck, it's tough, so tough
Gina works the diner all day working for her man
She brings home her pay, for love, for love

She says, we've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot

Woah, we're half way there
Woah, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Woah, livin' on a prayer

Tommy's got his six-string in hock
Now he's holding in what he used to make it talk
So tough, it's tough
Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
Baby, it's okay, someday

We've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot

Woah, we're half way there
Woah, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Woah, livin' on a prayer
Livin' on a prayer

Oh, we've got to hold on, ready or not
You live for the fight when it's all that you've got

Woah, we're half way there
Woah, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Woah, livin' on a prayer

HELLO DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!
Guess what?! It's only 3:12 AM!! I'm WAY ahead of schedule with this video and we recorded it yesterday! I LOVE Genre Switching covers! XD

Speaking of Genre Switching, Nate is leaving for a trip on Monday so we're gonna be working hard on Genre Switching 5 over the weekend. We already drew the names and there are some REALLY funny and REALLY epic combinations! Can't wait for y'all to hear them!

Anyway, Claire Corlett just left last week and BOY did we have fun! She was an amazing guest! She's also just a TIIIINY bit crazy, but I like that. :-P We went quadding, flying, swimming, shooting, and we also went to a water park in Phoenix and to the Titan Missile Museum (I love taking people there. Amazing insight into the terrifying and often forgotten Cold War). All in all, we had a great time and I hope I get to see her again soon. I may tease her a lot on social media but believe it or not I actually like her (don't tell her I said that).

Easter egg time? How about another cover with the legendary Daniel Ingram?!
This one was a challenge... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvNTItLMSxs
Ok, that's enough. I should probably go to bed. The sun isn't even up yet!! Crazy!!

LOVE YOU ALLLLL!!

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!

Ok... Ok ok ok, I REALLY need to fix my blasted sleep schedule... It's 6:25am as I'm typing this and I know by the time I'm done uploading it's gonna be around 7:00am... I still haven't done the thumbnail yet so if it's crappy, that's why... XD

So hey, I don't know who needs to hear this right now but you are loved and valued and treasured and you matter just as much as everybody you respect and look up to... I don't usually say things like that because I always found it kinda cheesy, but there's a LOT of anger and fear and hatred in the world right now and I feel like this is a good time to spread a positive message. Human value isn't calculated by race, gender or status. It doesn't increase with age or wealth or social standing. It can't be bought with money or boosted with friends. It isn't something you gain with a job title, or loose when you mess up. It's something each and every one of us is born with and it can't be taken away. No matter how many mistakes we make, no matter what people say about us, no matter how much we put ourselves down. We are valuable. In every sense of the word. We may be the only sentient life in the entire universe which makes us remarkably unique and incredibly rare! A physical anomaly and a scientific paradox. The only known anti-entropic collection of atoms in the universe! We create order from chaos. We explore. We create. We dream. We imagine. We invent. We are incredible! And while many of us make mistakes, history has shown that we get there eventually. I truly believe we will continue to grow. As individuals, as communities, as a race, as a species. I have faith in the good of mankind. I have faith in all of you. I believe we are stronger together BECAUSE of our differences, so please remember to tell someone how much they mean to you. Tell somebody you love them and also remember that there are LOTS of people who love you. Dearly. 

Shew! Ok, that kinda slipped out and I'm too tired to make it pretty, so take it or leave it. :-P

Want an easter egg? Here's a wholesome video of us shooting a milk jug full of water with a potato cannon while Claire enthusiastically reacts in the background! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etdaJfW5W3I

IIIII'm gonna try to go to sleep now.. I mean, after I make the thumbnail. Oof.

Hey. Love ya! Seriously..

- -- --- ---- Lyrics ---- --- -- -


I really dig how surface tension carries water to the stems
Converting carbon dioxide into lovely oxygen
And how they use that photosynthesis
Turning sunlight into food
There’s nothing in this world that puts me in a better mood

- Pre-Chorus:
Is there anything better than a tree?
If you ask me, it ain’t that hard to see

 - Chorus:
How about 20 million? 20 million trees!
Making 20 trillion little baby leaves
And I can’t help but choke up thinking about all the birds and bees
Living in 20 million, 20 million trees
Let's plant 20 Fir and 10 Cedar and a hundred Hickory
And a couple thousand Cottonwoods
Sounds pretty good to me
We’ll get some White Ash, Black Birch
And a million Red Pine
And a thousand Sugar Maple cause 
They’re lookin’ mighty fine
Ten thousand Honey-Locust standing proudly in the sun
And a million extra Oak trees isn’t hurting anyone
A couple hundred thousand Palm trees
Swaying in the ocean breeze
Deciduous, coniferous, and everything in between
Yeah yeah yeah!

Let’s plant 20 million, 20 million trees!

HELLO DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!
Ok, so this short video shouldn't have been very hard, right? That's what I thought, but I was wrong. Oh so very wrong... I've been working on this non-stop since 6:00pm yesterday. It's currently 5:22am and I'm exporting the 2nd draft... My back hurts.

I hope this is good. It BETTER be good! And by ""good"" I of course just mean the export. The video itself is freaking WEIRD!! Oh, so much weirder than I expected! I mean, we wrote this song to be funny, I made the video to be funny... How come when they're put together they turn out CREEPY?! Is it just me? I hope it's just me! XD

ANYWAY, this was a really fun video to make regardless! My favorite of this video had to be making the song though! Nate and I wrote and recorded ""20 Million Trees"" in less than 24 hours! It pretty much wrote itself. After we finished, I sent it to Jimmy (MrBeast) and Destin (Smarter Every Day) and the LOVED it! They asked if they could share it with everybody involved in this project, so hopefully, the song will do very well! Here's the FULL song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDJlZphf2sk

Anyway, I know y'all want an easter egg, so here are some outtakes from the video!

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!

WOW, what a wild ride this last month has been! I just got back from a two-week-long RV trip with my family I said in the White Frame Diaries (assuming you know what that is, if you don't... figure it out. ;-) It was a ton of fun (except for the part where California was on fire so we had to evacuate the trailer park as ash rained from the sky... and the cyanobacteria in the water at Zion.) All in all, though, the trip was wonderful! We went to Sequoia, Palm Springs, Ventura beach, Vegas, Zion, the Grand Canyon, and Lake Havasu! The only thing I regret is the fact that after I get back, I have SO MUCH to do it almost feels like the vacation isn't worth the catch-up! I have a very hard time relaxing when I think of all the work I SHOULD do doing. I don't know why I spoil things for myself. :-P

Anyway, if you're here for an easter egg, here's a video where Nate (Baasik) tried to throw me off a tube at Lake Havasu! We often rent a boat when we camp near a lake and we've both gotten pretty good at throwing each other. The trick is to use the whiplash maneuver. It's by FAR the hardest to sustain! Here's the clip! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZlA7Hd7mPw

Ok, I gotta sleep because you know how I said I was busy? Well, tomorrow I'm hading to the Wilcox Playa to meet up with some pilot friends and fly for the weekend... Because you know. For work. Wish me luck!

G-nite!

Oh BOY these videos always take longer to make than I expect. It's currently 8:07am as I type this and as much as I love watching the sunrise, I'd rather do it AFTER a good night's sleep... :-P

Oh, here's a cool updoot. In case you missed the white frame diary (if you don't know what that is, I was just kidding. Haha! There's no such thing!) where was I?... OH! In case you missed the White Frame Diary that doesn't exist, I'm flying to Virginia next month to do an impression video in an F-18 in support of Fleet Week New York!! I don't think anybody has ever done THAT before! XD Anyway, the pilot is gonna pull increasingly more G's and I'm gonna try to do as many voices as I can before I pass out (Ha! I'm not gonna pass out, but they can try!)
Either way, it should make for an interesting video!

Ok, now for an easter egg... Well, since I'm gonna be flying soon, check out this PPG Highlight reel as a warm-up! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bO6bnjdB7vc

WOW! Hi guys. I'm on a road trip so this is being uploaded from the road! But enough about me... how are you?! Are you enjoying some of my newest videos? I'm trying to branch out more with fun challenges and games like this. I think it's so fun! As always, I'm constantly looking for new stuff so if you have any ideas of things you'd like me to do, try, impersonate, or sing... I'd love to hear them!

HELLO DDR’S!! (Dedicated Description Readers)

I am sitting in an RV with my family, just outside of Las Vegas right now!  Just finished exploring the strip and watching an episode of Parks & Rec. Now I’m sitting on the seatbelt-couch typing this into my phone. SO... did you like the video? This is the first video on my channel that I didn’t spend a second editing! literally everything was done by Claire. The only thing I did was write this description and do the impressions. She’s even gonna paste this text into the video tomorrow! Anything you wanna add, Claire? :-3 [not really! besides... welp, hi! safe travels!]


Honestly, I was pretty nervous about having her do EVERYTHING because there’s a lot I usually do and it was weird relinquishing control, but it was either this or no video for the two weeks I was gone. I think she’s doing an amazing job!!  I hope you guys have been liking the new content!  As you know, I’m always open to new ideas so feel free to let me know if you have a good one! Best way to reach me is on Twitter @BlackGryph0n.


Easter egg? I got you, fam! I filmed a quick video this afternoon when we were driving into Vegas! It’s super random and unscripted, just like life. :-P https://youtu.be/3OoiTVhVrb4



OK, I’m gonna go to bed before I pass out. Goooooodniiight!!

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!
Yep. I was VERY sick. I had a fever of 103 when I shot that video. Fortunately, I'm feeling a lot better now, but I barely even remember doing it. Thankfully, my sister Zanna edited it for me and made it into something usable. Otherwise, I'd have nothing for you this week...
I'm actually pretty excited tonight, because this Sunday, I'll be flying to Maryland and hopping in an F-18 to do some impressions! Should be an interesting video! I've also got some stuff planned with the EOD and base security, so I'll have some cool vlog-type content coming out soon! Hope you enjoy it!
Ok, now for an easter egg... How about this! Some of you may know I voice a character named Barnaby in the upcoming game ""Billy Bust-Up"". We did a podcast a while and someone made this cute animatic to a bit I did with Kovox (who plays Fantoccio in the game). HERE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mujWN3DAumg

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!

It’s actually not late at night right now! It’s 11:55 AM on Thursday, and I am on my way to the Flying Circus! (intentionally vague because it’s a private event and I don’t want it being overcrowded ;-)
Basically, it’s a weekend where a bunch of small aircraft pilots get together and enjoy the sky! Last year we had autogyros, hot air balloons, bush planes, WWII fighters, and of course, lots of paramotors! Here’s a clip:
https://youtu.be/wtjCWufxR9E

I’m actually thinking of vlogging it this year! Claire is coming so I’ll have someone to point the camera, which will be nice! Is it something you guys would be interested in seeing?

ALSO!! I’ve been doing a lot of non-YouTube projects lately, which is why I haven’t been posting a lot… Most of them are still secret, but what I can talk about! I’ve been working with Daniel Ingram on a new children’s show called “TreeBees”! Our first album is out now! https://twitter.com/dannyimusic/status/1358085101897150464?s=21

OK, well we arrived so I got to get set up and flying before it gets dark! Hopefully, you’ll be watching me make this description in a few weeks when this video goes live on YouTube!

Byeee!

After thinking about all of this for years, I pieced together a theory of what might have happened to cause all of this...
My dad bought land from a farmer in the middle of nowhere, about a hundred feet from a dirt road. It's miles from any development but it's easy to get there in a car, making it the perfect place for a murder. No lights, no security footage, and nobody would ever find a body out there because the tilling machines would turn it into fertilizer. My guess is that somebody kidnapped and murdered a child on the exact spot my dad built the addition. When we dug the foundation and disturbed her resting place, she came back to tell us what happened. Either that or it was just a bunch of weird house sounds... REALLY weird house sounds. ^^;

If anybody wants to do some of their own research, our old house is on 480th Avenue, a little over a mile north of Hoversten Orchards... http://www.hoverstenorchard.com/  
Please let me know if you find anything.

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!

SHEW! Working on this video was extremely unsettling... Weird vibes around the house or the last few days. I think it'll be a while before I do another scary story, though to be fair, that's probably the spookiest thing that's ever happened to me. :-P

Do any of you have stories like that? I'd love to hear them! Great time of year to share ghost stories! If you do write a ghost story in the comments, please tag it with # DDRGhost so I can find it! :-)

Oh, by the way, when I texted my brother and asked him to tell the story from his perspective, he sent me TEN MINUTES of footage, and even though it has been years since we talked about what happened in that house, he told the stores EXACTLY the way I remember them! It was honestly kind of freaky watching his video right after I recorded mine. You should have seen poor Claire. She was NOT enjoying it. :-P
Anyway, what better easter egg than to share my brother's side of the story in its entirety!
Heeeere you go: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aec8zBTdAhk

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!
Correct! It's 6:14am, how did you guess? I'm typing right now. Bet you didn't know that!
Ok, but seriously, lemme tell you about what happened toda-er... yesterday. I woke up to a sink filled with fruitloops and a giant spoon with a message on the mirror that said ""Enjoy your breakfast!"" Then I went to use the bathroom and thank GOODNESS it was number one because when I lifted the seat there were about 10 ""poppers"" under it. That probably would have given me a heart attack! Then I went downstairs and there was a tray full of ""brownies"" for us all to enjoy. Of course, they were actually several letter ""E's"" cut out of brown paper... Then I went to have some milk and it was EXTREMELY salty... total waste of milk but it made Claire and Zanna LOL so I guess it was worth it? A few hours later Claire discovered some dog poop on the floor and she went to clean it up... then ate it (it was chocolate). Then the pranks slowed down for a while until the night rolled around and Zanna brought out a tray of ACTUAL brownies for all of us! Yay! I bit into one and... of course it was salty. Awesome. She made a tray of real brownies too though, so we were all happy in the end! Waiting for her to tell me in the morning that they were poisoned. That would be hilarious!
In all seriousness though, it was pretty fun! I'm just a LITTLE bummed I didn't get to prank anyone because I was too busy being poisoned.
ANYWAY, you're here for an easter egg, right? Ok, here goes... I'm about to break the rules and share a PaTrEoN ExClUsIvE with you just a day after it was posted... Don't tell Claire. ^^; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd13pHx3XJk

OK THE SUN IS UP so that means it's time for bed!

Sun’s out, clouds gone, autumn in the air
And a friend I’ve had throughout my life is waving at me over there
She stands in quiet solitude from the moment she was born
And her strength and perseverance make the cold air feel warm

- Pre-Chorus:
Is there anything better than a tree?
If you ask me, it ain’t that hard to see

 - Chorus:
How about 20 million? 20 million trees!
Making 20 trillion little baby leaves
And I can’t help but choke up thinkin' bout all the birds and bees
Living in 20 million, 20 million trees
Let’s plant 20 million, 20 million trees!
I'm talkin' bout

 - 2nd Verse:
I really dig how surface tension carries water to the stems
Converting carbon dioxide into lovely oxygen
And how they use that photosynthesis
Turning sunlight into food
There’s nothing in this world that puts me in a better mood

- Pre-Chorus:
Is there anything better than a tree?
If you ask me, it ain’t that hard to see

 - Chorus:
How about 20 million? 20 million trees!

Living in 20 million, 20 million trees
Let’s plant 20 million, 20 million trees!

 - Last Pre-Chorus:
Imagine if we all could plant one tree
Oh, what a better place this world would be

 - Last Chorus:
Let’s plant 20 million, 20 million trees!

And I can’t help but choke up thinking about all the birds and bees
Living in 20 million, 20 million trees!

 - Outro:
Let's plant 20 Fir and 10 Cedar and a hundred Hickory
And a couple thousand Cottonwoods
Sounds pretty good to me
We’ll get some White Ash, Black Birch
And a million Red Pine
And a thousand Sugar Maple cause 
They’re lookin’ mighty fine
Ten thousand Honey-Locust standing proudly in the sun
And a million extra Oak trees isn’t hurting anyone
A couple hundred thousand Palm trees
Swaying in the ocean breeze
Deciduous, coniferous, and everything in between
Yeah yeah yeah!

- -- --- ---- Lyrics ---- --- -- -

I saw you dancing in a crowded room
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye

I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away

You could have asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care

I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day

I made you think that I would always stay
I said some things that I should never say
Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
And now you won't love me for a second time

I don't know why I run away
Oh girl, I make you cry when I run away
Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that I'm much too late
And you deserve someone better
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day

I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day

HELLO DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!
So, I'm trying something new... I've hired my sister as an editor and I'm going to try to put two videos out per week! One on Friday (as usual) and an experimental video on Monday. That way I can experiment with different types of content and not get punished so brutally by the YouTube algorithm... Oof.
I'm looking forward to Monday's video! It's a new thing I'd LOVE to make into a series that's basically ""a day in the life of"" certain film and TV characters. We filmed the first one a few days ago and it's pretty funny. :-P

Y'all want an Easter-Egg? How bout this video of my shooting a flame thrower: https://twitter.com/BlackGryph0n/status/1379258436387434498?s=20
While you're at it, why not follow me on Twitter? I post a lot more over there...

Ok, I shall sleep now. Good morning!

- -- --- ---- Lyrics ---- --- -- -

Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends, then somebody bends
Unexpectedly

Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared, neither one prepared
Beauty and the beast

Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before, ever just as sure as the sun will rise

Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong

Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time, song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the beast

Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the beast

HELLO DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!
Well, I'm only a few days away from flying to Mississippippissipip to work with my brother on some new videos (thanks again to my Patrons for making that happen)! We hope to write a few new songs as well, but things have been pretty hectic for both of us lately as we prepare to move to LA... Rest assured though, we WILL be making more music once we're living in the same house again! :-P

OH, BY THE WAY!! My friend Jeff (ACRaceBest) drove down to Tucson to film a NASCAR race and, at the VERY last minute, the track asked me to fly the flag into the race! O_O
It was a CRAZY windy day so I had to active pilot like crazy to prevent my wing from collapsing, then right as I was about to land on the track, they started shooting off FIREWORKS and I had to pull a hard left to avoid getting shot out of the sky!! Needless to say, it was a crazy ride, but I'm glad I did it. :-P
Here's a picture that the track photographer took:  https://www.facebook.com/Tiffanymotorsports/photos/a.707639655951568/1902510459797809/?type=3&theater

That's not a good easter egg though... How about this!
I decided to upload my 2nd favorite take of this song (couldn't decide between takes 3 and 4, so I drew randomly then uploaded the other without music or audio from my mic.) This is straight from the camera and about as raw as you can get! If it were a steak, it'd still be walking! :-P
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-XP-Lw4AP0

Ok, that's all I can think of right now. I really need to stop doing my final edits at the last possible second! :-P

Goodnight everybop!

HELLO DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!
Ooook, so I legitimately have no idea what to write today! Things are so crazy with Christmas rolling around that I'm actually uploading on SATURDAY!! That's crazy, I ALWAYS have my video finished on Friday but I just completely ran out of time! Anyway, things are good except for the fact that I'm sick. It's almost part of the experience at this point. Every year around Christmas time I get the same gift from mother nature; a sore throat and congestion. It's just a part of the experience for me at this point. I actually get excited when my nostrils start to take turns letting air through. ""YAY! I'm starting to feel crappy! It must be Christmas time!"" my primitive cerebrum exclaims.

Anyway, I'm trying to think of an easter egg... Or uh... Christmas present? for you!
I was hoping Thumb Wars would be out by now, but production has run into some setbacks. There IS another trailer out now though! It's starting to look pretty good! XP
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOmHgzAH_Eo
I CAN tell you that I play 6 characters in this and from what Steve has shown me, it's going to be VERY funny! Still not sure where it's gonna end up but I'll keep you posted!

Ok, well I have a massive headache (YAY! Another Christmas tradition!) so I'm gonna go to sleeeep. It's only 5:32am! Not bad!

HELLO! DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!
Oh WOW! I am SOOOOOO tired... I haven't been sleeping well lately. Lots on my mind as Christmas approaches. It's definitely different this year, I won't be seeing some of my family members this Christmas and that makes me sad... but I also have a lot to be thankful for!

OH! Something SUPER cool happened to me! I was leaving my LZ last week after a PPG flight, and a guy in a truck pulled up next to me and flashed his lights. I stopped and opened my window and he asked if I ever saw any cows when I was flying... I told him I did, quite frequently, and he asked if he could have my number in case he needed help locating them (there are a lot of free-range cattle around here). Two days ago, I got a text from his son saying they were near my area and, if I was planning to fly, they would love to know if I happened to see any cattle. I told them I'd meet them at the field and when I pulled up, I saw three cowboys with lassoes sitting on three beautiful horses! I had a chat with them and they told me where they needed the cows to go. After I took off, I surveyed the area and while I only spotted one at first, eventually I found a large group of about 20, just a few miles from the LZ. I spiraled over the location and the cowboys galloped in my direction. Once I got low, I noticed that the cattle would run from me if I got close enough, so I started hearding a group of them together and in the direction of the cowboys. It wasn't long before I had ten cows stampeding through the wash, and the cowboys were close behind, twiring their lassoes over their heads! They were able to rope a few of them by the time I landed, and once I touched down, they paid me for my fuel and said they'd love my help whenever I'm available!

It was honestly one of the coolest things I've done this year and from now on I'd prefer if you call me by my new title ""air-cowboy"" as I feel I have earned it. I hope to work my way up to ""space-cowboy"" someday. Gotta start somewhere!

I wish I had a video... And I DO! Here's my GoPro footage of the whole thing! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkqaBzJIseM

Ok, the sun is coming up, that's my cue to go to bed.

Love y'all!

Ok... So I'm venturing into ""personality"" territory here. There are only so many impressions I can do before it gets repetitive. I'll be monitoring this video to see how it performs, so if you like stuff like this, share it around! The more views/likes it gets, the more likely I am to make more videos like it! (And of course, I'll still do impression and singing videos, I'll just do these videos too so I can upload more often!)

And now... the links and the credits! *at least the crickets appreciate it.*

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!

Well, it's that time of night again! You know, the time where the sun comes up and I'm typing instead of sleeping? :-P I don't know why I always do this. It doesn't matter how ""easy"" I try to make this for myself, I ALWAYS find something to nit-pick until I'm literally out of time and I need to upload the video or I'll miss my window (which is usually Friday at 10:00am PST... With the exception of today. :-P)

Anyway, as I said above, I'm really trying to come up with some new, more ""personality-based"" content so I can put out videos more often. I like doing the music stuff but it's a lot of work and there's only so much I can do before it gets repetitive. I'm thinking I'll try to upload a BIG video (impressions, genre switching, etc) once a month, and a smaller (song association game, vlog, etc) every week or so. Glad I have claire! She's killing it in the editing department! I love her quirky editing style, it seems to compliment my personality nicely. :-P

Okaaaaay, Easter Egg... Ok, here's one! So, in my last video, when I made that joke about the ""super popular singer"" then showed an old picture of me with my name under it, a LOT of people didn't know it was me... I guess the picture wasn't recognizable since it's almost 10 years old and I'm in my uniform... so here's a video of me in the 7th Fleet Band singing in a different language: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb8DVnYbZuk

Ok, I gotta sleep! We're going to a harvest festival tomorrow!! YAAAAYY!!

LOVE YOUUUU!!!

I don't know what I am missing
Were you missing all along?
Along

I'm just begging you to listen
Can you listen to me at all?

I’m sorry I just don't get why you’re caught up in this mess 
But I'm not trying to guess
No more...

And I'm sorry I don't know why you're pushing me to the side
I just can't handle your pride
No more...

It's like an evolution in your brain
Burning like a fever that you can't contain
Growing till your soul will be as cold as stone
But nobody will notice cause you're always on your own
Maybe it's somebody that you don't like
Will you keep letting them control your life?
Don't you say you know you're gonna be alone
Why don't you take a moment to get off your thrown and
Show me what you got?

Instead of thinking that nobody cares then pushing everyone away
(What you got)
Instead of trying to convince yourself that nothings gonna be ok
(What you got)
Instead of blaming somebody else think you’ve got a little more say
(What you got)

Won't you
Show me what you got?
Can you
Show me what you got?

I don't know what I envisioned
but the vision could have been wrong
Wrong...

I'm just trying hard to listen
If I listen can you be strong?
Be strong

There's just been way too much stress
It could be me, I confess
Maybe we just need a rest
Or more...

And I'm sorry I don't know why
I feel like something has died
I just don't think I can try
No more...

Cause,
It's like an evolution in my brain
Burning like a fever that I can't contain
Growing till my heart will be as hard as stone
But nobody will notice cause I'm always on my own
Maybe it's somebody I used to like
Will you be running from it all my life?
Don't you say you know I'm gonna be alone 
Why don't you take a moment to get off your thrown and
Show me what you got?

How can I show you that somebody cares if you keep pushing me away?
(What you got)
Am I just trying to convince myself that everything will be ok?
(What you got)
Instead of listening to someone else, could I have a little more say?
(What you got)

Won't you
Show me what you got
Can you
Show me what you got

It’s like an evolution in your brain...
It’s like a fever that you can’t contain...
It’s like an evolution in my brain...
It’s like a fever that I can’t contain...

I don’t know what I am missing
Are you missing me at all?.....

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!!
I'm sitting in our fantastic Island-View Villa at Disney's Aulani Resort in Honolulu, Hawaii right now; wearing a nice Hawaiian shirt and sporting a patchwork sunburn! My tourist look is on point!

I spent most of the day filming for the next music video ""Letdown"" coming July 19th. I also rescued a young sea-turtle from a tiny overheating tide-pool today but IDK if I can share that footage without people going all ""ANIMAL CRUELTY"" on me. XP

OH! So when I was cutting the footage together I ended up with a crap ton of unused footage that I randomly happened to play after exporting the music vid and it was kinda fun! So I bounced about half of it into what I'm calling a ""Mini-vlog""
It was pretty easy, so I might do one of these for every music video if y'all like it! Lemme know what you think!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7MwkHGAjNA&feature=youtu.be

OK, I gotta go watch some fireworks now. Love y'all and happy 4th!! (Even though it's definitely not the 4th when you're reading this...)

- -- --- ---- Lyrics ---- --- -- -

Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold

Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
You are not alone

'Lone, alone
Why, 'lone

Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

-CHORUS-

Whisper three words and I'll come runnin'
And girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

-CHORUS-

You are not alone (You are not alone)
I am here with you (I am here with you)
Though you're far away (Though we're far away, you and me)
I am here to stay (You are always in my heart)

WELCOME TO THE END OF THE DESCRIPTION, DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!
Ok, I HAVE to talk about Hawaii because it was AMAZING!! I've been to Guam and the Philippines before, but I was always working so I didn't have a lot of time to enjoy it... Not the case in Hawaii!

A bit of backstory, the reason I went is because my brother, Nate (Baasik) was sent there by the Navy to be a part of something called RIMPAC. He's in charge of a team of oceanographers and they are surveying/mapping pearl harbor (or something like that). :-P
While I was down there, we rented a car (a 2017 Mazda 3, which is my car! So that was cool!) and then just drove around looking for random non-touristy places to hike/snorkel. We got pretty lucky with the marine life and saw about 15 Green Sea Turtles! Now, you're not supposed to touch them, but this one turtle near Sharks Cove on the North Shore was so curious and friendly that it was difficult to avoid touching him as he almost swam directly into us several times! Here are a few clips I cut together really quickly. Look at that visibility!! 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MgILjSgr0k&feature=youtu.be


Boy, I'd love to tell you more about what I've been working on lately, but most of the stuff is under NDA... I promise I'll let you know as soon as I can though!

Ok, I'd better sleeeeeep... The sun is coming up, so I guess that's my cue. :-P

NIGHTYNIGHT!!

This is a new thing for us, but I think it turned out pretty well! We recorded the piano and lead first, then we did the beat and harmonies, then because two takes weren't enough, we added a few more harmonies and a keyboard solo. :-P

Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Well it doesn't show signs of stoppin'
And I brought some corn for poppin'
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss good-night
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Well the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still good-bye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, and snow

HELLO DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!
Ok, so I'm here in Mississiisisosisoisyoushouldhavepickedmercy with my brother Nate and we're working on Christmas Presents, another Genre Switching Challenge for next Friday and of course the video I just uploaded, but we actually have something else in mind... I know I've teased it for a while and it's been put off a number of times due to us both being busy, but it's really looking like we may actually do another album! We have some really strong songs that we've written and really only need to record at this point! I wish I could give you a teaser... AND I CAN!
Here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ8KwSWykrI&feature=youtu.be

WARNING: This is VERY VERY early in production (as in I took the chorus sample from Nate and wrote lyrics twenty minutes ago, then recorded quiet vocals in Audacity two minutes ago so I wouldn't wake him up. He doesn't know I recorded this so he may be pretty mad when he finds out and make me take it down.. I guess we'll find out. :-P)

Anyway, I brought y'all these pies (no, that's not true, I just had that line from Zootopia stuck in my head and I couldn't think of anything else until I wrote it down). It's currently 3:30am for me and I'm wide awake because this is way earlier than when I usually finish my Friday upload! I'm also Jetlagged so there's that. Hey, what are you doing for Christmas? (or Hanukkah, or Kwanzaa, or whatever you celebrate). Any cool plans? Any traveling? I'd love to know cause I'm nosey! :-D

Ok, that's all I can think of right now...

Merry everything!

~Gabe

- -- --- ---- Lyrics ---- --- -- -

A single thread in a tapestry though its color brightly shines
Can never see its purpose in the pattern of the grand design.
And the stone that sits on the very top of the mountain's mighty face
Does it think that it's more important than the stones that form the base?

So how can you see what your life is worth
Or where your value lies?
You can never see through the eyes of man!
You must look at your life
Look at your life through heaven's eyes

lai-la-lai lai-lu-lai-lai...(2X)

A lake of gold in the desert sand is less than a cool fresh spring
And to one lost sheep, a shepherd boy is greater than the richest king.
If a man lose everything he owns has he truly lost his worth
Or is it the beginning of a new and brighter birth?

So how do you measure the worth of a man
In wealth or strength or size?
In how much he gained or how much he gave?
The answer will come
The answer will come to him who tries
To look at his life through heaven's eyes!
And that's why we share all we have with you though there's little to be found
When all you've got is nothing there's a lot to go around!
No life can escape being blown about by the winds of change and chance
And though you never know all the steps you must learn to join the dance!
You must learn to join the dance!

lai-la-lai lai-lu-lai-lai...(3X)

So how do you judge what a man is worth, by what he builds or buys?
You can never see with your eyes on earth, look through heavens eyes.
Look at your life
Look at your life
Look at your life through heavens eyes!

HI AGAIN DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers). Don't know why I keep putting the brackets, I'm pretty sure you already know that down here, DDR doesn't stand for Dance Dance Revolution.

So I FINALLY have a few weeks off, which means I have a few weeks to make content! Thought I'd drop a cover for y'all while I'm working on my LOTR impression video (hopefully releasing next Friday). After that, I'm going to Mississippippi to visit my brother Nate (Baasik) for a few weeks, and also work on some new music and probably another Genre Switching Challenge! :-P

After that, it's off to Australia fro Alicon!! WOO!! I'm super excited! I haven't been to the land down under for like, five years, so I'm super stoked to go back! Any chance any of y'all will be there?

OH, since we're on the Christian topic, here's a video I shot and edited while I was in South Dakota. Celebrate church sent their youth students to camp in Missouri and I went along with them to film with the Phantom (drone). We played this video Sunday for the congregation, but we played the music live. I'm pretty happy with it! :-)

“Oh, what a letdown.”
He sighs and shakes his head, ignoring what she said
She's gonna stick around, but she'd rather be somewhere else instead
Ignoring what he said.
Neither one acknowledges the other could be right.
And neither one apologizes, they would rather fight.
They’ll be yelling at each other every night. Every night.
And they'll be screaming ‘till they see the early morning light.

But what can he do about it?
And what can she do about it?

""Oh what a letdown!
What a shame, you complain, you're the same and you're not gonna change!""
He said, and she said
""Why don't you get down and explain cause I'm waiting for change out of you any day!""
She said, and he said
""Oh, what a letdown.""

“My misery is your personal mission!""
She angrily replies
""This isn't Oprah, so why don't you turn off that television?”
So caught up in their lies
That neither one acknowledges the other could be right
And neither one apologizes, they would rather fight.
They're still yelling at each other every night. Every night.
And they'll be screaming till they see the early morning light.

""Oh what a letdown!
What a shame, you complain, you're the same and you're not gonna change!""
He said, and she said
""Why don't you get down and explain cause I'm waiting for change out of you any day!""
She said, and he said
""Oh, what a letdown.""

Stop and think about it
Will they ever know for sure?
They don't know if they can take it anymore
Anymore, anymore.
So they stop and think about it
Because they finally know for sure
And they're not gonna doubt it anymore
Anymore, anymore

""Oh what a letdown
What a shame I complain, stay the same I don't want you to change!""
She said, and he said
""I'm gonna get down
And explain that I’m praying you’re staying the same every day.""
He said, and she said
""Oh, what a letdown.""

ALOHA DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!!
Man... THIS video took a long time to make! There were over three hours of footage I had to sort through to try and find three minutes worth of highlights! I think I captured the essence of our trip though, and that's all I was trying to do.

It's currently 6:42am and I am JUST NOW exporting the ""Mini-vlog"" made from the spare footage that didn't make it into the music video... It's uh... It's 16 minutes long. I didn't want to cut too much out though, as it's a great video to send to the rest of my family so they can re-live the trip! (I put the shark footage and the sea-turtle rescue in there, too!)

Oh yeah! The name of our album is ALSO hidden in this video! You only have a week to guess what it is, because we'll be announcing the name and opening pre-orders next Friday! Woo! :-D

Ok, I need to go to sleep! Here's the mini-mega-vlog: https://youtu.be/ka3MikHXfY0

- -- --- ---- Lyrics ---- --- -- -


End of May or early June this picture-perfect afternoon we shared
Drive the winding country road, grab a scoop at À La Mode and then we're there
An open field that's framed with trees we pick a spot and shoot the breeze like buddies do
Quoting songs by our favorite bands telling jokes no one understands except us two
And we talk and take in the view

All we see is sky for forever
We let the world pass by for forever
Feels like we could go on for forever this way
Two friends on a perfect day

We walk a while and talk about the things we'll do when we get out of school
Bike the Appalachian trail or write a book or learn to sail wouldn't that be cool?
There's nothing that we can't discuss like girls we wish would notice us but never do
He looks around and says to me ""There's nowhere else I'd rather be"" and I say, ""me too""
And we talk and take in the view
We just talk and take in the view

CHORUS

And there he goes racing toward the tallest tree
From far across the yellow field I hear him calling, ""follow me""
And there we go wondering how the world might look from up so high
One foot after the other
One branch then to another
I climb higher and higher
I climb 'til the entire sun shines on my face

And I suddenly feel the branch give way
I'm on the ground - My arm goes numb
I look around - And I see him come to get me
He's come to get me - And everything's okay

CHORUS

HELLO DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!
WOOOW! Back from Hawaii and BOY was it crazy! What an adventure! The Browns are the coolest family (not us, the other Browns that I stayed with) Crazy talented, funny and humble! It was a pleasure seeing the island with them! I also hung with a local dude named Sage. He showed me all the cool non-touristy spots in Kauai! Almost killed me, too. ;-P

Ok, it wasn't his fault, but he took me to a place where the surf is SUPER high and if you're dumb enough to go swimming, the only way to get out is to ride a wave back to the top of the 20-foot cliff you jumped off of. If you screw it up you either get scraped up by the rocks or drown. I didn't screw it up and managed to get out, but then another HUGE wave took me right back off and tossed me around a few minutes... It was pretty gnarly. Honestly, I thought I was going to drown, but I managed to fight the riptide long enough to climb out onto a shallower spot a few hundred feet away from where I fell. When I climbed out of the water, I found a lava rock about the size of a grape embedded in my heel. My right leg was pretty scraped up too. Most of the scratches are healed now, but a few were pretty deep and are still pretty painful. I probably should have gotten stitches but it was hard to tell at the time. Anyway, I'm alive and that's good. :-)

OH! You want an easter egg, don't you?! I mean, it's only fitting so close to easter! Here's a video for one of the songs I sang in the Easter show. (These songs were written by an 18-year-old if you can believe it... I feel old.) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnJ5B0tXP4

And in case you missed the link at the top of the description, here's the latest demo from me and Nate's new album! (Nobody has guessed the name of the album yet, but we have left a lot of hints in a lot of secret places. If you look hard enough, you'll figure it out. ;-) https://youtu.be/_gOkqT1FYg0

Ok, time for me to put my face on a pillow until I forget what words mean.

'Till next time!!

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!

Ok, I'm gonna keep this brief because I have to get up at 10:00am for a Livestream that starts RIGHT when this video goes live! It's for a video game I'm in called Billie Bust Up. I voice a ghost owl named Barnaby. It's cute! You should totally check it out! Daniel Ingram does the music so you know it's gonna be good! Here's the trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn3ZP2uSab0

Speaking of Daniel Ingram, for the last few months we've been working together on a MASSIVE project for a new children's musical show called TreeBees! We just released a Christmas album if you care to check it out! I play a character named Timber, Vincent Tong plays Zo and Bethany Brown plays Millie. (We've recorded almost a hundred songs so far!! O_O) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul00YDft-bE&list=OLAK5uy_nkSr8gWgNlf4JfnWxONcP8nB7WDvIjiiU&index=2

Also, I'm just got a new mic! My friend Samuel Kim bought it for me to celebrate our ""Toss A Coin To Your Witcher"" cover getting 20 million streams on Spotify! It's a Neumann TLM-103 and it sounds super crispy! A lot more dynamic than my AT2020! Nate and I recorded our new song using that mic and I can't WAIT for y'all to hear it!! :-D

ALSO also, I'm just finished doing a thing for Netflix that I can't talk about, but I promise to show you as soon as it comes out! I'm excited! :-D

Told you I've been busy! :-P Ok, I need to sleep because I'm starting to see that flying fish again...

G-nite!

Born to wander
I hear the call a thousand miles away
And it's keeping me, keeping me awake
A restless blood is running through my veins
We are born to wander.

And every day I hear the distant call
The more I wait, the more I start to fall
I guess I don't belong here after all
We are born to wander.

And if I don't belong here
I guess I'll never know
I don't know where to go
But it's alright
Because I wasn't made for this
Never gonna settle down
We are born to wander

We are, we are
Feeling this all around
Not gonna settle down
We are born to wander
We are, we are
Feeling this all around
Not gonna settle down
We are born to wander

We were not designed to stay in place
We travel over land and sea and space
The mystery that drives the human race
We are born to wander

And if I don't belong here
I guess I'll never know
I don't know where to go
But it's alright
Because I wasn't made for this
Never gonna settle down
We are born to wander

We are, we are
Feeling this all around
Not gonna settle down
We are born to wander
We are, we are
Feeling this all around
Not gonna settle down
We are born to wander

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!!
Ok, so I'm currently sitting in my hotel in Baltimore Maryland, just putting the finishing touches on the video! I'm also extremely tired so there's that! Unfortunately, I gotta take a shower and prepare to get up early-ish tomorrow so I don't have time to export a mini-vlog just yet... :-(

But can I interest you in a poorly filmed video of our 4th of July firework show! Nate and I made a few of our own mortar tubes that were slightly wider than the shells so they blew up niiiice and low! ;-P

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!

WOW... I mean WOW!! The last two weeks have been CRAZY! I mean, my life is always a bit crazy, but lately, it's been REALLY crazy! This whole ""Inspiration4 Contest"" completely consumed my life! I've ALWAYS wanted to go to space, so when I heard there was a chance I could go, I stopped EVERYTHING I was doing and focused all of my attention on the contest! Drove my family crazy! :-P

Anyway, I didn't win. Ho-hum. As a voice actor who spends a LOT of time auditioning, I'm used to rejection, but man... this one hit hard. I REALLY thought I had a shot at this. I followed all the rules, had one of the most viral videos, and worked my BUTT off designing merch. Even the other contestants told me they thought I was gonna win, so I was SURE I'd at least be a finalist... I was REALLY excited about filming a song and an impression video in space! Oh well... Still, I think what Jared Isaacman is doing is pretty incredible and I wish him and the rest of the crew the very best of luck! I guess the next step for me is to become a billionaire so I can pay the 55 million dollar fee to get a seat on the Dragon Capsule! Shouldn't be too hard...

Or, yaknow, maybe I could convince one of the private space companies to send me up as a spokesperson! If any of you work for SpaceX, NASA, Blue Origin, or Rocket Labs and are looking for someone to shoot into orbit... Let me know! XD

Oh, right... Easter egg. Let's see... OH! Here's an interview I did with a brilliant young man named Felix who runs a YouTube channel about space! He's AWESOME! Check it out! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em8-7gsSPfg

Ok, it's late, as usual... so I'd better go to sleeeeep... See y'all soon!

This is our 4th take. Recorded in Audacity on my Neumann TLM-103 mic, filmed on my iPhone, and synched up in Adobe Premiere. No tuning, or video cuts.
This song was WAY harder than we expected! We both kept messing it up... Eventually, I printed out the lyrics and you DEFINITELY can't tell I was reading them... ^^;

You know I want you. It's not a secret I try to hide.
I know you want me. So don't keep sayin' our hands are tied.
You claim it's not in the cards and fate is pullin' you miles away
And out of reach from me
But you're here in my heart, so who can stop me if I decide
That you're my destiny?

What if we rewrite the stars? Say you were made to be mine
Nothing could keep us apart. You'd be the one I was meant to find
It's up to you, and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be, So why don't we rewrite the stars?
Maybe the world could be ours... Tonight

You think it's easy? You think I don't wanna run to you?
But there are mountains
And there are doors that we can't walk through
I know you're wondering why because we're able to be
Just you and me within these walls
But when we go outside, you're gonna wake up and see
That it was hopeless after all

No one can rewrite the stars. How can you say you'll be mine?
Everything keeps us apart and I'm not the one you were meant to find
It's not up to you, it's not up to me
When everyone tells us what we can be. How can we rewrite the stars?
Say that the world can be ours... Tonight

All I want is to fly with you
All I want is to fall with you
So just give me all of you
It feels impossible
It's not impossible
Is it impossible?
Say that it's possible

How do we rewrite the stars? Say you were made to be mine?
Nothing can keep us apart 'cause you are the one I was meant to find
It's up to you, and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be so why don't we rewrite the stars?
Changing the world to be ours...

You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
But I can't have you
We're bound to break and my hands are tied

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!!

AAAAH! You GUYS I'm so BUSY!! It's literally taken me almost a month to move into my new house because I'm working on so many projects! I guess that's a good problem to have, though. And getting settled in my new house is very fun! Would any of y'all be interested in a vlog/house tour? I'm still iffy on making something like that, but if there's interest, I'll do it!

Oh, and since a few of you have been asking about an update on dearMoon, the short answer is I don't know yet... the long answer is IIIIIII DOOOOOONNN'T KNOOOOOW YEEEET! (Haha, I'm twelve.) But seriously, the whole process has been very secretive and there's not much I can talk about. As far as I know, though, everybody is still waiting to find out if they're going, so I guess I'll just keep my fingers crossed!

Anyway, you probably want an easter egg, right? How about this epic video of me and Nate doing ""weed control"" in my backyard! There are these VICIOUS cactuses where I live called Teddy Bear Cholla (or Jumping Cactuices) and they are almost impossible to kill! Luckily, I found out they burn quite easily, and while this doesn't kill them, it DOES get rid of all their nasty spines and makes them much more friendly to bump into. :-P (And don't worry, we made sure to do this on a calm day. No wind, and no surrounding brush.) ENJOY: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBGVlnZD_dI

Ok, my eyelids are getting heavy, so I'm gonna close them now.
G'NITE!

If I'm selected for dearMoon, my goals are:
- To learn and grow with the rest of the crew as we help each other accomplish our dreams.
- To write and record a song in space that inspires a new generation of actors, artists, and music lovers to take interest in space and STEM.
- To film a music video featuring my fellow crewmembers and breathtaking shots of the earth and moon using the best equipment of our time.

In summary, I want to tell a powerful story through music and video that puts our small but beautiful home into perspective; inspiring us to take care of both our planet AND each other, and encouraging humanity to look to an exciting future among the stars, not JUST as individuals, but as fellow members of the human race!

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!
Hi! I'm at Naval Station Norfolk right now, trying to recover from some of the most intense four days of my life! Over the last 96 hours, I have been through flight training, ejection and parachute simulation, underwater vehicle escape, and helo rescue training at Pax River Naval Base.
Dynamic maneuvers while singing in an F-18 out of Naval Air Station Oceana.
Obstacle course, Demolitions, repelling, night vision, robot ops, bomb suit, and intensive training with the EOD at JEB Little Creek.
And M240 live-fire drills, OC Spray Course, Active Shooter policie simulation, and a squad car ride with the MA's at JEB Little Creek.
To say that I'm exhausted is an understatement, but I loved every minute of it!! (Huge thank you to Fleet Week New York, and to Ensign James Caliva for setting all this up for me!)

I will be making a few videos covering the WHOLE experience over the next few weeks, but here's a quick easter egg to tide you over! This was one of the more intense moments in the F-18 when we pulled 7.5 G's in a low-level strafing maneuver! Lieutenant Stalin is one HECK of a pilot!! https://youtu.be/j9cRKizfse8

Ok, I'd like to make this longer, but I'm exhausted and I have a long journey home ahead of me...

Night!!

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!

Hey, guess what?! I'M TIRED!! I bet you didn't see that one coming!
Seriously though, I miss you guys... It's been too long. You'd think it would be easy for me to put out a lot more content now that every other project of mine has been canceled, but the truth is I've had a really hard time staying motivated to make new stuff... I feel like I'm in a bit of a creative rut. I guess it's hard to focus on projects when there's all this uncertainty. I was supposed to have relocated to LA by now but I'm basically just waiting... Still, I'm gonna try to do more YouTube stuff. Hopefully I can find something fun and easy that everybody will like... I'd LOVE some ideas if you've got any! ^^;

Oh, I'd actually love to give a huge shout out to Claire Corlett for all her help on this video! Things have been pretty crazy in her life too, but she has stayed so incredibly positive and driven through it all! Her strength and determination inspires me and I have a ton of respect for her! I can't thank her enough for all her help! If anybody is reading this, you should totally go hit her up on twitter and let her know how awesome she is. She already knows, but it's always nice to hear it again. :-P https://twitter.com/ClaireMCorlett

As long as I'm giving shout outs, I GOTTA mention my parents who have been kind enough to let me hunker down at their place during quarantine (and pretty much whenever). I love you both SO MUCH! You're the best parents a guy could ask for and I'm SO LUCKY to have been born to you! Your encouragement and constant support (even when I'm being stupid) are the reason I'm where I am today! Your strength, kindness, tenacity, selflessness, and incredible work ethic set the standard to which I hold myself and I could only hope to be half the person both of you are!

And last but not least, thank YOU! The person dedicated enough to read this message! If it weren't for people like you I never would have made this video or any of the videos on my channel. Your views and comments inspire me to create and I hope in turn the stuff I create inspires you to watch and comment some more! Let's continue to PUSH each other, eh? Love ya!

Ok, easter egg time... You know, I'm not sure what to put... I mean, I usually make a video like this one for the easter egg... OH! Oh wait, I have the PERFECT video for these times! Here I am chucking a roll of perfectly good TOILET PAPER out of my paramotor!! Oh, if I had only known... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcMvHFw2cnM

OK, I'm gonna go to sleep now! GOODNIGHT!! THANKS AGAIN! HERE'S TO 5m (and hopefully 10m one day!! O_O)

Love you all!

- Michelle:
My return is a mystery
Thought you had control of me 
I'm offended that you're so surprised.

That first defeat was a practice round 
But I pulled myself off the ground
And I've already planned your demise.

- Gabe:
I won't stop fighting cause I'm not done yet
You're gonna regret
This time I won't let you forget.

- Nate:
You're not gonna get away this time
I'll strike when you're blind
You'll awake just to find you are mine.

- Gabe & Michelle:
You thought you won
Thought the battle was over
But I, I, I, I'm just getting stronger.

Enjoy your freedom
It won't last much longer 
Cause I, I, I, I keep getting stronger.

- Nate:
When the sky turns to grey
When the light fades away

- Michelle:
You will say, I just keep getting stronger!

- Gabe:
You can try to prepare
Or attack if you dare

- Michelle:
I don't care, cause I'm just getting stronger.

- All:
I, I, I, I'm just getting stronger!
I, I, I, I'm just getting stronger!
I, I, I, I'm just getting stronger!
I, I, I, I'm just getting stronger!

- Michelle & Gabe:
I am the nightmare that replays in your head
I am the shadow lurking under your bed.

And when I lose it's never really the end
You should have known I'd have a plan for revenge.

- Nate, Gabe, Michelle:
And I won't stop fighting cause I'm not done yet
You're gonna regret
This time I won't let you forget

You're not, gonna get away this time
I'll strike when you're blind
You'll awake just to find, you are mine

- Gabe & Michelle:
You thought you won,
Thought the battle was over,
But I, I, I, I'm just getting stronger.

Enjoy your freedom, 
It won't last much longer 
Cause I, I, I, I keep getting stronger.

- All:
When the sky turns to grey
When the light fades away
You will say, I just keep getting stronger!

Stronger every day
Stronger every day...

- All:
I, I, I, I keep getting stronger!
I, I, I, I keep getting stronger!
I, I, I, I keep getting stronger!
I, I, I, I keep getting stronger!

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!!

So, I'm currently in Adelaide Australia! I'm also currently sick! Lost my voice to a nasty cold, so while I'm no longer contagious, my throat is very sore and I can't speak... This will be an interesting show tomorrow... ^^;

The trip has been pretty epic so far! I met up with the Crebers in Melborne and spent the last three days driving along the Great Ocean Road. The coast is beautiful and we saw a lot of Cokatu, Emu, Walabys, and of course Kangaroos! Also saw about a thousand flying-foxes in the Adaliade botanical gardens! (BOY do I wanna cuddle one forever!)

But enough about my trip... What do you guys think of the animation? I mean, I know it's not what you're use to seeing on my channel, but I thught it was too epic not to share. Would you be interested in seeing more stuff like this, or would you rather I just stick to the ME stuff? :-P

Ok, Easteregg! So, It's a bit hard to upoload one while I'm here since I'm pretty busy, but I DO have this older clip my dad uploaded from when I got ""rescued"" while climbing on the rocks in SIoux Falls, so that's fun: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbcXuewoPEU

Ok, I'm gonna make some tea and lie down... Ouch. :-(

Love y'all!

Flashback to the day that you went  away
You said to see your family
But I ran into you yesterday
And you never saw it coming baby.

I know you knew what I thought
Did you leave or not?
You said that you meant to but you forgot
And I never saw it coming

It should have been so easy
But I feel incomplete
Thinking about you
And I would just let you be
But I consistently
Think about you
Think about you!

I know you’re keeping secrets
Hoping that I won’t see this
But for whatever reason
I think I like it!
Feels like there’s something missing
At least it’s something different
And I can’t help this feeling
I think I like it!

You’re a mystery.
History to you but girl it’s new to me.
I wish that I could say it happened naturally 
But I never saw it coming, baby

I never guessed that we could get this far.
Well, honestly I really don’t know where we are
And would it be as fun if it was less bazaar?
Cause we never saw it coming, baby!

It should have been so easy
But I feel incomplete
Thinking about you
And I would just let you be
But I consistently
Think about you
Baby do you think about me too?

I know you’re keeping secrets
Hoping that I won’t see this
But for whatever reason
I think I like it!
Feels like there’s something missing
At least it’s something different
And I can’t help this feeling
I think I like it!
I think I like it!
I think I like it!

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!!

This is the first time I made a YouTube video designed to be watched on a phone! It was fun, but it also took way longer than expected and now I am DEAD tired! Still, writing a short DDR won't hurt, right? RIght.
Oje, lets see. It's currentyl 7:28 am and I'mwatching the sun rise. It's beautiful, but I wash it wasn't happening. I know I'm making a lot of typos, but I'm leaving them because I don't want to correct them, and also it's kinda funny.

Oh, right, easter egg. Ok. Um.... Well, I didn't make one this time because I just finished the video 20 minutes ago, but OH! This might work! Here's a vidoe Claire made for my patrons on Patreon yesterday! It was made to announce this video and show a little behind the scenes, but I suppose it's served it's purpose now, so y'all can watch it!

She packed my bags last night pre-flight
Zero hour 9:00 a.m.
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then

I miss the Earth so much I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home Oh, no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone

(Repeat)

Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact, it's cold as helllllo. (kid-friendly channel)
And there's no one there to raise them If you did

And all this science I don't understand
Is just my job five days a week
A rocket man, A rocket man

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home Oh, no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time

HELLO DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!
Oh my gosh, you guys... You have no idea how hard I've been working on this Insperation4 contest! I seriously want to go to space more than anything I've ever wanted. I've always dreamed of being an astronaut and THIS is the best chance I may ever get! I'm also SO EXCITED about the idea of bringing my love of spaceflight to an audience that may never have heard or cared about it if I didn't go! Can you IMAGINE if I did a song or impression video from ORBIT?!

Also, if I may vent for a second... I'm extremely frustrated that, despite my 4.5 million followings, I can't even get 100k views and 10k retweets on my submission video because it doesn't have anything to do with music. One of the judging criteria is virality and I honestly thought I had that one in the bag, but I guess not...

Anyway, I'm not EXPECTING to win... I just REALLY want to! I followed all the submission guidelines, but a lot of other people didn't... Not sure if that will get them disqualified or not. It says in the rules that we're not allowed to use any music, so if someone who put music in their video wins, I'll be pretty frustrated considering my whole bid is to do music in orbit and it would have helped my case a lot if I had known that rule didn't really matter. :-P

Also, one of the judges already implied to a different contestant that he was voting for her, so I guess I don't have his vote... Hopefully, I can get the votes of the other three. ^^;

OK, I need to stop ranting. It's late and I should be trying to relax. :-P
Want an easter egg? Here's one! I recently did an interview with ""The Launch Pad"" about my love of science and spaceflight and why I want this seat so badly! Check it out! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVO8REXRY2w&feature=youtu.be

Ok, I'm gonna try to go to sleep while imagining what astronaut training would be like!

HELLO DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!
WOW! My first video on Monday! I feel like a real YouTuber!

Anyway, I don't have a ton of time right now because my Brother is here and we are gonna go to the Desert Museam (I don't know how to spell museaum. Museaulumpum). ALSO, I'm working on a new impression video for Friday so I gotta keep pluggin' away at that! It's shorter which means it's less work, which means I can make more of them. I'm hoping I can find the perfect balance of quality AND quantity so I can keep my audience AND the algorithm happy as I shrivel into a husk of a man, battered and beaten down by the cold, unfeeling demands of a heartless computer algorithm that holds my fate in its ones and zeros like a baby bird as it decides who is famous, and who is poor......            LOL JKJK!

Ok, here's an easter-egg. I flew Claire like a kite yesterday while camping on Mars. This easter egg is longer than the actual video! HA! https://youtu.be/y-gIM1LSOuc

Ok, time to leave. HOPE YOU LOVE THE VIDEOOOO!!

I know they're not as popular as my other stuff, but they're easier to make so I can put a video out every week now! Heading to Seattle next week to work on some new music with Nate (Baasik) so watch for a video featuring him soon!

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!

Today was a fun day!! It was Amber's birthday (she's my sister's husband's sister), so NATURALLY we went all out! :-P We went to the zoo where my sister discovered she was wearing the same colors as the feeding staff. All the animals were VERY interested in her and came right up! The lion was particularly interested. It was kinda scary. I couldn't help but imagine what it would have been like if the glass weren't there... O_O

Anyway, after the zoo, we went to Krispy Kreme and they gave Amber a DOSEN free donuts! Then we went to the park to burn off the guilt before going to dinner at a fancy-schmancy restaurant. I split a Bolognese with Claire. Then we went home, had a few drinks, then did cake and presents. Overall a very fun day!

OH YEAH! And here's that ""Facts about Black Gryph0n"" video I was talking about! It's honestly scary accurate with a lot of very obscure details (like the medals I earned while serving in the 7th fleet), but surprisingly inaccurate with some more obvious ones (like my height, hair color, and the name of my family album). :-P Overall though, it's well done and an interesting watch if you care to know a little bit more about moi. :-3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WA4mQipyiA

Ok, I gotta go to sleep now. Fish are flying through my room and I don't think they want me to stay awake anymore.

NIIIIGHT!!

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!
Oh boy... As I'm sure you all know, I've been working my BUTT off for the past few weeks on becoming one of the first civilian astronauts with Inspiration4. Unfortunately, it's looking like I didn't make the cut this time, but I have another opportunity with DearMoon, which is the first civilian mission AROUND THE MOON!! Granted, my odds are quite a bit lower for this one, as over a MILLION people have applied to go, but they DID say they were looking for artists and musicians, so maybe I can get Yusaku Maezawa's attention! I REALLY want to record a write and record a song/music video in space! My application is in and I will know if I made the shortlist by April sooo.... Wish me luck!

(If you wanna help me on this journey, you can always tag @yousuck2020 or @yousuckMZ on Twitter and tell him you want to see @BlackGryph0n write and record a song in space! https://twitter.com/yousuck2020 )

IN THE MEANTIME, I am really excited about a few things coming up! For one... I am probably gonna be buying my first house before the end of April! So I'll keep you posted on that. ALSO, I have a VERY cool opportunity lined up with the U.S. Navy that I can't talk about just yet... but if it all works out (and it looks like it will) expect a very cool series of videos on my channel by the end of May!

What's that? Easter egg you say? Well, how about this rough cut of my favorite Paramotor flights last year! I was thinking of making this into an actual video, but I'm not sure if people would actually want to watch it since there's no singing. :-P https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bO6bnjdB7vc

Ok, time to go to sleeeep, I have a big day of physical fitness exams tomorrow!

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!
This was a LOT of fun, and there's a LOT more where this came from! Next Friday, I'll be uploading a video where I try to do impressions in an F-18 while pulling over 7 Gs and doing loops, barrel rolls, wingovers, and all kinds of dynamic maneuvers! It was AWESOME and I can't wait for you to see it!

I also did a bunch of stuff with the EOD and I'll be posting that video on the Monday following my F-18 video, so definitely stay tuned for that! We blew up a car! XD

Oh, BTW, I bought a HOUSE! So that's cool! Still working on moving all my stuff in though... I'm super busy (I guess that goes without saying these days). I'll do a house tour video soon, but for the time being, here's a picture: https://twitter.com/BlackGryph0n/status/1395536104695029765?s=20

Also, in case you missed it, here's a clip of me in the F-18! This was one of the more intense moments when we pulled 7.5 G's in a low-level strafing maneuver! https://youtu.be/j9cRKizfse8

Ok, I need sleep. I wish I didn't, but I do. I hate the fact that I'm going to spend 1/3 of my life sleeping! XD

And now... the links and the credits! *I smell popcorn...*

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!

I have something kinda cool to announce and I finally got the OK from the U.S. Navy! Next week, I'll be flying to Norfolk VA to support ""Fleet Week NY"" where I'm gonna hop in an F-18 to shoot an impression video while pulling G's and trying not to pass out! After that, I'm gonna spend a day with the EOD and try on their bomb suit, run their obstacle course, and repel from a building! Then, I'm gonna spend a day with Base security, ride around in a squad car and go to the shooting range, and maybe even get tased! I'm gonna make as many videos as possible about it, and I'm open to suggestions if you can think of anything fun!

Here's the trailer: https://twitter.com/FleetWeekNYC/status/1386712705017450502?s=20

Ok, I gotta go watch Twilight with my family now. SUCH a good movie.

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!
This was one of the most intense days ever!! The amount of stuff we did in one day was INSANE! Especially since I had flown in an F-18 the day before and was still sore from all the training! It was SO much fun, and also kind of nostalgic. It's been almost 14 YEARS I joined the Navy and qualified for SEAL training. It feels like a distant memory, but coming back to JEB Little Creek made it all come flooding back. I'm so greatful to have been given this opportunity and I owe a HUGE thanks to some people who don't want to be credited... You know who you are.

It was also pretty hard for Claire to film and edit this video because there was a LOT of stuff we weren't allowed to film (we were on a spec ops base afterall). HUGE thanks to her for being patient and understanding through the whole process!

Want an easteregg? How about this! It's my patreon exclusive video from the month of April! (Don't tell Claire I shared this with you.. It's supposed to be for Patrons only. :-P) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSU6yO0uM5o

THANK'S FOR WATCHING! I know these videos don't get a lot of views, so I'm EXTREMELY greatful for the few of you who care about me enough to watch things that don't involve singing. You're the best and I love you all!

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!
Wow, this whole experiance was very surreal! I was actually stationed at JEB Little Creek twelve years ago, and coming back to visit was... It's honestly hard to describe. The base hasn't really changed all that much. I remembered it like it was yesterday, but SO MUCH has happened since then... It really put my life into perspective and made me realize how quickly time gets away from us. It was kind of bitter-sweet, watching all those young sailors doing exactly what I did all those years ago. Now, I'm the old guy thinking ""aww, look at those kids, they have so much to learn"" kinda made me flash back to the countless times I heard my parents, bosses and CO's say the exact same thing to me. It doesn't really hit you until you say it yourself. Iit was like I finally understood what it means to be ""grown-up."" Does that make sense? Maybe that's weird to you, and if it is, I'm sorry. You'll probably understand someday. :-P

Ok, let's have an easter egg, shall we? For nostalgia's sake, here's a video that I filmed on this very same base over ten years ago! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkjzPcK9OHQ

I gotta go to bed now. Long day of house work ahead of me! Turns out, furnishing a house is a lot of work!

LOVE Y'ALL!!

I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey

I get drunk, wake up, I'm wasted still
I realize the time that I wasted here
I feel like you can't feel the way I feel
Oh, I'd be messed up if you can't be right here

Oh-oh-oh-whoa
Oh-oh-oh-whoa
Oh-oh-oh-whoa
Oh, I'd be messed up if you can't be right here

I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change even when I knew I never could
Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey

When I'm away from you, I miss your touch
You're the reason I believe in love
It's been difficult for me to trust
And I'm afraid that I'ma mess it up
Ain't no way that I can leave you stranded
'Cause you ain't ever left me empty-handed
And you know that I know that I can't live without you
So, baby, stay

Oh-oh-oh-whoa
Oh-oh-oh-whoa
Oh-oh-oh-whoa
I'll be messed up if you can't be right here

I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
Know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change even when I knew I never could

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!!
WOW! A lot has been going on in my life lately! I finally got moved into my new house and I'm in the process of unpacking! I might post a house tour on here, but I also might not... I've been doing some reading on the (current) YouTube algorithm and it turns out if you don't post content exactly like your popular stuff, YouTube assumes your channel is dead and stops recommending your videos to people... Even your subscribers. So yeah, if I want my views to go back up, I gotta post only music stuff. Oh well, maybe I'll make a new channel for my adventure videos!

Anyway, I'm pretty excited about the new Minecraft song me and Nate wrote! It's written from the perspective of a Creeper and it's a bop IMO. We hired an incredible animator to make a music video for it that will be coming out at the end of August, so we're looking forward to that! WOO!

Also, here's a fun easter egg! For those of you who don't know, Claire makes these awesome videos for my Patrons that update them on my recent shenanigans. I'm not supposed to share the latest ones, but sometimes I like to share the old ones, so here's a mini-vlog from the month of June! Enjoy! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QJ7p_4ljxs

Ok, the sun is coming up, so that means it's bedtime! Gooonite!

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!
This was my 4th year attending the Arizona Flying Circus and I swear it gets crazier every year! I've been hesitant to post videos like this in the past because I was worried nobody would want to watch it, but at this stage, I don't really care.
It would be nice if more people watched my vlog-style videos, but what REALLY matters is that I like making them and sharing them with you! I'm grateful for those of you who care enough about me to stick around and watch what's happening in my crazy life. :-)

So, to all of you who watch these videos AND read to the end of the description... THANK YOU!!

Oh, and here's an easter-egg! Claire makes these AMAZING Patreon specials and sometimes I just have to share the old ones with y'all! Hopefully my patrons won't mind... :-P https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfQExEI0V-w

HELLO DDR'S (Dedicated Description Readers)!
I KNOW this isn't the kind of content you're used to, but I REALLY appreciate those of you who watched it AND read to the end of the description! Thank you so much! I've been learning a lot about the heartless YouTube algorithm, and I think I finally understand it better. I know what I have to do to get more views again, and, unfortunately, I have to stop making videos like this... Turns out, every time I upload an ""unpopular"" video that people don't click on, the algorithm stops recommending my new videos to every person who doesn't click on the previous one... I really enjoy giving you guys a glimpse into my private life, but it just isn't sustainable. Thank you for watching this long. I will continue to make videos of course! Just not every week because I need to stick to the stuff that's popular; the music stuff.

That said, I have a new Minecraft song coming out soon that I'm VERY excited about!! Stay tuned!

OH! Here's an easter egg for you! I can FINALLY SAY that I'm a candidate for the dearMoon project! If I'm selected, I get to GO TO THE MOON AND WRITE A SONG IN SPACE!! OMG!! Here's the official video, featuring me and some of my fellow candidates! Awesome, right?! I REALLY hope I get to go!!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE5vdpFlamI
