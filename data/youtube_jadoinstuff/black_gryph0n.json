IDK if you've ever watched Hazbin Hotel but it's basically a show about life in hell. This song is about the character Alastor, who is a very powerful demon. He was a DJ in the 1920's and ALSO a serial killer. I like to think that the power he has in hell is proportionate to the amount of unspeakable crimes he committed on earth, but IDK if that's canon. Anyway, this song takes place at the moment of his death on earth and subsequent arrival in hell. He quickly begins to accept his fate, come into his power, and he even meet's an old \"friend\" from earth. I'm sure Alastor's friend is happy to see him too!... ;-)\n\nANYWAY, enough about the song! I just got back from a week-long trip to LA for a super-secret thingy... I promise I'll give you more details when I can. It was pretty intense, but Claire and I had a blast in my off time! We met up with a bunch of friends, ate a bunch of food, and even went to Disney Land! We wanted to see the Avengers Campus but there was a four-hour line just to GET IN!!

This was one of the more intense moments when we pulled 7.5 G's in a low-level strafing maneuver! https://youtu.be/j9cRKizfse8\n\nOk, I need sleep. I wish I didn't, but I do.

It's not a secret I try to hide.\nI know you want me. So don't keep sayin' our hands are tied.\nYou claim it's not in the cards and fate is pullin' you miles away\nAnd out of reach from me\nBut you're here in my heart, so who can stop me if I decide\nThat you're my destiny?\n\nWhat if we rewrite the stars? Say you were made to be mine\nNothing could keep us apart. You'd be the one I was meant to find\nIt's up to you, and it's up to me\nNo one can say what we get to be, So why don't we rewrite the stars?\nMaybe the world could be ours... Tonight\n\nYou think it's easy? You think I don't wanna run to you?\nBut there are mountains\nAnd there are doors that we can't walk through\nI know you're wondering why because we're able to be\nJust you and me within these walls\nBut when we go outside, you're gonna wake up and see\nThat it was hopeless after all\n\nNo one can rewrite the stars. How can you say you'll be mine?\nEverything keeps us apart and I'm not the one you were meant to find\nIt's not up to you, it's not up to me\nWhen everyone tells us what we can be. How can we rewrite the stars?\nSay that the world can be ours... Tonight\n\nAll I want is to fly with you\nAll I want is to fall with you\nSo just give me all of you\nIt feels impossible\nIt's not impossible\nIs it impossible?\nSay that it's possible\n\nHow do we rewrite the stars? Say you were made to be mine?\nNothing can keep us apart 'cause you are the one I was meant to find\nIt's up to you, and it's up to me\nNo one can say what we get to be so why don't we rewrite the stars?\nChanging the world to be ours...\n\nYou know I want you\nIt's not a secret I try to hide\nBut I can't have you\nWe're bound to break and my hands are tied\n\n- -- --- ---- End ---- --- -- -\n\n\n\n\nHELLO DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!\nOh WOW, this has been an eventful month! I got super sick, I spent a week doing stuff with the Navy in Virginia, I bought a house yesterday, and I was in a Fleet Week New York ad in Times Square today, BUT there's another thing that, if it works out, will make all that other stuff PALE in comparison... I actually can't tell you what it is, but believe me... It's big. Like, life-changing big... I'll keep you posted on the status and let you know what it is as SOON as I can... In the meantime, enjoy guessing. I won't tell you if you got it right, but YOU'LL know you did once I finally announce it. ;-)\n\nOk, let's see... easter egg... OH!

You think I don't wanna run to you?\nBut there are mountains\nAnd there are doors that we can't walk through\nI know you're wondering why because we're able to be\nJust you and me within these walls\nBut when we go outside, you're gonna wake up and see\nThat it was hopeless after all\n\nNo one can rewrite the stars. How can you say you'll be mine?\nEverything keeps us apart and I'm not the one you were meant to find\nIt's not up to you, it's not up to me\nWhen everyone tells us what we can be. How can we rewrite the stars?\nSay that the world can be ours... Tonight\n\nAll I want is to fly with you\nAll I want is to fall with you\nSo just give me all of you\nIt feels impossible\nIt's not impossible\nIs it impossible?\nSay that it's possible\n\nHow do we rewrite the stars? Say you were made to be mine?\nNothing can keep us apart 'cause you are the one I was meant to find\nIt's up to you, and it's up to me\nNo one can say what we get to be so why don't we rewrite the stars?\nChanging the world to be ours...\n\nYou know I want you\nIt's not a secret I try to hide\nBut I can't have you\nWe're bound to break and my hands are tied\n\n- -- --- ---- End ---- --- -- -\n\n\n\n\nHELLO DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!\nOh WOW, this has been an eventful month! I got super sick, I spent a week doing stuff with the Navy in Virginia, I bought a house yesterday, and I was in a Fleet Week New York ad in Times Square today, BUT there's another thing that, if it works out, will make all that other stuff PALE in comparison... I actually can't tell you what it is, but believe me... It's big. Like, life-changing big... I'll keep you posted on the status and let you know what it is as SOON as I can... In the meantime, enjoy guessing. I won't tell you if you got it right, but YOU'LL know you did once I finally announce it. ;-)\n\nOk, let's see... easter egg... OH! Here are some outtakes from the last Song Association Game. Claire put this compilation together. :-P https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItgwwhxD1F4\n\nI must sleeeep... Big day tomorrow. LOVE YOUUOOUU!!\n\n~Gabe"

I've hired my sister as an editor and I'm going to try to put two videos out per week! One on Friday (as usual) and an experimental video on Monday. That way I can experiment with different types of content and not get punished so brutally by the YouTube algorithm... Oof.\nI'm looking forward to Monday's video! It's a new thing I'd LOVE to make into a series that's basically \"a day in the life of\" certain film and TV characters. We filmed the first one a few days ago and it's pretty funny. :-P\n\nY'all want an Easter-Egg? How bout this video of my shooting a flame thrower: https://twitter.com/BlackGryph0n/status/1379258436387434498?s=20\nWhile you're at it, why not follow me on Twitter? I post a lot more over there...\n\nOk, I shall sleep now. Good morning!\n\n~Gabe",

I've hired my sister as an editor and I'm going to try to put two videos out per week! One on Friday (as usual) and an experimental video on Monday. That way I can experiment with different types of content and not get punished so brutally by the YouTube algorithm... Oof.\nI'm looking forward to Monday's video! It's a new thing I'd LOVE to make into a series that's basically \"a day in the life of\" certain film and TV characters. We filmed the first one a few days ago and it's pretty funny. :-P\n\nY'all want an Easter-Egg? How bout this video of my shooting a flame thrower: https://twitter.com/BlackGryph0n/status/1379258436387434498?s=20\nWhile you're at it, why not follow me on Twitter? I post a lot more over there...\n\nOk, I shall sleep now. Good morning!\n\n~Gabe"

As I'm sure you all know, I've been working my BUTT off for the past few weeks on becoming one of the first civilian astronauts with Inspiration4. Unfortunately, it's looking like I didn't make the cut this time, but I have another opportunity with DearMoon, which is the first civilian mission AROUND THE MOON!! Granted, my odds are quite a bit lower for this one, as over a MILLION people have applied to go, but they DID say they were looking for artists and musicians, so maybe I can get Yusaku Maezawa's attention! I REALLY want to record a write and record a song/music video in space! My application is in and I will know if I made the shortlist by April sooo.... Wish me luck!\n\n(If you wanna help me on this journey, you can always tag @yousuck2020 or @yousuckMZ on Twitter and tell him you want to see @BlackGryph0n write and record a song in space! https://twitter.com/yousuck2020 )\n\nIN THE MEANTIME, I am really excited about a few things coming up! For one... I am probably gonna be buying my first house before the end of April! So I'll keep you posted on that. ALSO, I have a VERY cool opportunity lined up with the U.S. Navy that I can't talk about just yet... but if it all works out (and it looks like it will) expect a very cool series of videos on my channel by the end of May!\n\nWhat's that? Easter egg you say? Well, how about this rough cut of my favorite Paramotor flights last year! I was thinking of making this into an actual video, but I'm not sure if people would actually want to watch it since there's no singing. :-P https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bO6bnjdB7vc\n\nOk, time to go to sleeeep, I have a big day of physical fitness exams tomorrow! \n\n~Gabe",

I mean WOW!! The last two weeks have been CRAZY! I mean, my life is always a bit crazy, but lately, it's been REALLY crazy! This whole \"Inspiration4 Contest\" completely consumed my life! I've ALWAYS wanted to go to space, so when I heard there was a chance I could go, I stopped EVERYTHING I was doing and focused all of my attention on the contest! Drove my family crazy! :-P\n\nAnyway, I didn't win. Ho-hum. As a voice actor who spends a LOT of time auditioning, I'm used to rejection, but man... this one hit hard. I REALLY thought I had a shot at this. I followed all the rules, had one of the most viral videos, and worked my BUTT off designing merch. Even the other contestants told me they thought I was gonna win, so I was SURE I'd at least be a finalist... I was REALLY excited about filming a song and an impression video in space! Oh well... Still, I think what Jared Isaacman is doing is pretty incredible and I wish him and the rest of the crew the very best of luck! I guess the next step for me is to become a billionaire so I can pay the 55 million dollar fee to get a seat on the Dragon Capsule! Shouldn't be too hard...\n\nOr, yaknow, maybe I could convince one of the private space companies to send me up as a spokesperson! If any of you work for SpaceX, NASA, Blue Origin, or Rocket Labs and are looking for someone to shoot into orbit... Let me know! XD\n\nOh, right... Easter egg. Let's see... OH! Here's an interview I did with a brilliant young man named Felix who runs a YouTube channel about space! He's AWESOME! Check it out! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em8-7gsSPfg\n\nOk, it's late, as usual... so I'd better go to sleeeeep... See y'all soon!\n\n~Gabe",

I mean WOW!! The last two weeks have been CRAZY! I mean, my life is always a bit crazy, but lately, it's been REALLY crazy! This whole \"Inspiration4 Contest\" completely consumed my life! I've ALWAYS wanted to go to space, so when I heard there was a chance I could go, I stopped EVERYTHING I was doing and focused all of my attention on the contest! Drove my family crazy! :-P\n\nAnyway, I didn't win. Ho-hum. As a voice actor who spends a LOT of time auditioning, I'm used to rejection, but man... this one hit hard. I REALLY thought I had a shot at this. I followed all the rules, had one of the most viral videos, and worked my BUTT off designing merch. Even the other contestants told me they thought I was gonna win, so I was SURE I'd at least be a finalist... I was REALLY excited about filming a song and an impression video in space! Oh well... Still, I think what Jared Isaacman is doing is pretty incredible and I wish him and the rest of the crew the very best of luck! I guess the next step for me is to become a billionaire so I can pay the 55 million dollar fee to get a seat on the Dragon Capsule! Shouldn't be too hard...\n\nOr, yaknow, maybe I could convince one of the private space companies to send me up as a spokesperson! If any of you work for SpaceX, NASA, Blue Origin, or Rocket Labs and are looking for someone to shoot into orbit... Let me know! XD\n\nOh, right... Easter egg. Let's see... OH! Here's an interview I did with a brilliant young man named Felix who runs a YouTube channel about space! He's AWESOME! Check it out! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em8-7gsSPfg\n\nOk, it's late, as usual... so I'd better go to sleeeeep... See y'all soon!\n\n~Gabe"

It's currentyl 7:28 am and I'mwatching the sun rise. It's beautiful, but I wash it wasn't happening. I know I'm making a lot of typos, but I'm leaving them because I don't want to correct them, and also it's kinda funny.\n\nOh, right, easter egg. Ok. Um.... Well, I didn't make one this time because I just finished the video 20 minutes ago, but OH! This might work! Here's a vidoe Claire made for my patrons on Patreon yesterday! It was made to announce this video and show a little behind the scenes, but I suppose it's served it's purpose now, so y'all can watch it!\nHere ya go! youtube.com/watch?v=uc0Pb0P8kKk\n\nOK GOOONIHTHUIHENFI\n\n~Me",

I haven't been sleeping well lately. Lots on my mind as Christmas approaches. It's definitely different this year, I won't be seeing some of my family members this Christmas and that makes me sad... but I also have a lot to be thankful for!\n\nOH! Something SUPER cool happened to me! I was leaving my LZ last week after a PPG flight, and a guy in a truck pulled up next to me and flashed his lights. I stopped and opened my window and he asked if I ever saw any cows when I was flying... I told him I did, quite frequently, and he asked if he could have my number in case he needed help locating them (there are a lot of free-range cattle around here). Two days ago, I got a text from his son saying they were near my area and, if I was planning to fly, they would love to know if I happened to see any cattle. I told them I'd meet them at the field and when I pulled up, I saw three cowboys with lassoes sitting on three beautiful horses! I had a chat with them and they told me where they needed the cows to go. After I took off, I surveyed the area and while I only spotted one at first, eventually I found a large group of about 20, just a few miles from the LZ. I spiraled over the location and the cowboys galloped in my direction. Once I got low, I noticed that the cattle would run from me if I got close enough, so I started hearding a group of them together and in the direction of the cowboys. It wasn't long before I had ten cows stampeding through the wash, and the cowboys were close behind, twiring their lassoes over their heads! They were able to rope a few of them by the time I landed, and once I touched down, they paid me for my fuel and said they'd love my help whenever I'm available!\n\nIt was honestly one of the coolest things I've done this year and from now on I'd prefer if you call me by my new title \"air-cowboy\" as I feel I have earned it. I hope to work my way up to \"space-cowboy\" someday. Gotta start somewhere!\n\nI wish I had a video... And I DO! Here's my GoPro footage of the whole thing! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkqaBzJIseM\n\nOk, the sun is coming up, that's my cue to go to bed.\n\nLove y'all!\n\n~Gabe",

It's for a video game I'm in called Billie Bust Up. I voice a ghost owl named Barnaby. It's cute! You should totally check it out! Daniel Ingram does the music so you know it's gonna be good! Here's the trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn3ZP2uSab0\n\nSpeaking of Daniel Ingram, for the last few months we've been working together on a MASSIVE project for a new children's musical show called TreeBees! We just released a Christmas album if you care to check it out! I play a character named Timber, Vincent Tong plays Zo and Bethany Brown plays Millie. (We've recorded almost a hundred songs so far!! O_O) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul00YDft-bE&list=OLAK5uy_nkSr8gWgNlf4JfnWxONcP8nB7WDvIjiiU&index=2\n\nAlso, I'm just got a new mic! My friend Samuel Kim bought it for me to celebrate our \"Toss A Coin To Your Witcher\" cover getting 20 million streams on Spotify! It's a Neumann TLM-103 and it sounds super crispy! A lot more dynamic than my AT2020! Nate and I recorded our new song using that mic and I can't WAIT for y'all to hear it!! :-D\n\nALSO also, I'm just finished doing a thing for Netflix that I can't talk about, but I promise to show you as soon as it comes out! I'm excited! :-D\n\nTold you I've been busy! :-P Ok, I need to sleep because I'm starting to see that flying fish again...\n\nG-nite!\n\n~Gabe",

It's for a video game I'm in called Billie Bust Up. I voice a ghost owl named Barnaby. It's cute! You should totally check it out! Daniel Ingram does the music so you know it's gonna be good! Here's the trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn3ZP2uSab0\n\nSpeaking of Daniel Ingram, for the last few months we've been working together on a MASSIVE project for a new children's musical show called TreeBees! We just released a Christmas album if you care to check it out! I play a character named Timber, Vincent Tong plays Zo and Bethany Brown plays Millie. (We've recorded almost a hundred songs so far!! O_O) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul00YDft-bE&list=OLAK5uy_nkSr8gWgNlf4JfnWxONcP8nB7WDvIjiiU&index=2\n\nAlso, I'm just got a new mic! My friend Samuel Kim bought it for me to celebrate our \"Toss A Coin To Your Witcher\" cover getting 20 million streams on Spotify! It's a Neumann TLM-103 and it sounds super crispy! A lot more dynamic than my AT2020! Nate and I recorded our new song using that mic and I can't WAIT for y'all to hear it!! :-D\n\nALSO also, I'm just finished doing a thing for Netflix that I can't talk about, but I promise to show you as soon as it comes out! I'm excited! :-D\n\nTold you I've been busy! :-P Ok, I need to sleep because I'm starting to see that flying fish again...\n\nG-nite!\n\n~Gabe"

It was Amber's birthday (she's my sister's husband's sister), so NATURALLY we went all out! :-P We went to the zoo where my sister discovered she was wearing the same colors as the feeding staff. All the animals were VERY interested in her and came right up! The lion was particularly interested. It was kinda scary.

You know, the time where the sun comes up and I'm typing instead of sleeping? :-P I don't know why I always do this. It doesn't matter how \"easy\" I try to make this for myself, I ALWAYS find something to nit-pick until I'm literally out of time and I need to upload the video or I'll miss my window (which is usually Friday at 10:00am PST... With the exception of today. :-P)\n\nAnyway, as I said above, I'm really trying to come up with some new, more \"personality-based\" content so I can put out videos more often. I like doing the music stuff but it's a lot of work and there's only so much I can do before it gets repetitive. I'm thinking I'll try to upload a BIG video (impressions, genre switching, etc) once a month, and a smaller (song association game, vlog, etc) every week or so. Glad I have claire! She's killing it in the editing department! I love her quirky editing style, it seems to compliment my personality nicely. :-P\n\nOkaaaaay, Easter Egg... Ok, here's one! So, in my last video, when I made that joke about the \"super popular singer\" then showed an old picture of me with my name under it, a LOT of people didn't know it was me... I guess the picture wasn't recognizable since it's almost 10 years old and I'm in my uniform... so here's a video of me in the 7th Fleet Band singing in a different language: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb8DVnYbZuk\n\nOk, I gotta sleep! We're going to a harvest festival tomorrow!! YAAAAYY!!\n\nLOVE YOUUUU!!!\n\n~Gabe",

So I'm venturing into \"personality\" territory here. There are only so many impressions I can do before it gets repetitive. I'll be monitoring this video to see how it performs, so if you like stuff like this, share it around! The more views/likes it gets, the more likely I am to make more videos like it! (And of course, I'll still do impression and singing videos, I'll just do these videos too so I can upload more often!)\n\nAnd now... the links and the credits! *at least the crickets appreciate it.*\n\n\nEdited by my AMAZING off-screen-associate!

You know, the time where the sun comes up and I'm typing instead of sleeping? :-P I don't know why I always do this. It doesn't matter how \"easy\" I try to make this for myself, I ALWAYS find something to nit-pick until I'm literally out of time and I need to upload the video or I'll miss my window (which is usually Friday at 10:00am PST... With the exception of today. :-P)\n\nAnyway, as I said above, I'm really trying to come up with some new, more \"personality-based\" content so I can put out videos more often. I like doing the music stuff but it's a lot of work and there's only so much I can do before it gets repetitive. I'm thinking I'll try to upload a BIG video (impressions, genre switching, etc) once a month, and a smaller (song association game, vlog, etc) every week or so. Glad I have claire! She's killing it in the editing department! I love her quirky editing style, it seems to compliment my personality nicely. :-P\n\nOkaaaaay, Easter Egg... Ok, here's one! So, in my last video, when I made that joke about the \"super popular singer\" then showed an old picture of me with my name under it, a LOT of people didn't know it was me... I guess the picture wasn't recognizable since it's almost 10 years old and I'm in my uniform... so here's a video of me in the 7th Fleet Band singing in a different language: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb8DVnYbZuk\n\nOk, I gotta sleep! We're going to a harvest festival tomorrow!! YAAAAYY!!\n\nLOVE YOUUUU!!!\n\n~Gabe"

I just got back from a two-week-long RV trip with my family I said in the White Frame Diaries (assuming you know what that is, if you don't... figure it out. ;-) It was a ton of fun (except for the part where California was on fire so we had to evacuate the trailer park as ash rained from the sky... and the cyanobacteria in the water at Zion.) All in all, though, the trip was wonderful! We went to Sequoia, Palm Springs, Ventura beach, Vegas, Zion, the Grand Canyon, and Lake Havasu! The only thing I regret is the fact that after I get back, I have SO MUCH to do it almost feels like the vacation isn't worth the catch-up! I have a very hard time relaxing when I think of all the work I SHOULD do doing. I don't know why I spoil things for myself. :-P\n\nAnyway, if you're here for an easter egg, here's a video where Nate (Baasik) tried to throw me off a tube at Lake Havasu! We often rent a boat when we camp near a lake and we've both gotten pretty good at throwing each other. The trick is to use the whiplash maneuver. It's by FAR the hardest to sustain!

I just got back from a two-week-long RV trip with my family I said in the White Frame Diaries (assuming you know what that is, if you don't... figure it out. ;-) It was a ton of fun (except for the part where California was on fire so we had to evacuate the trailer park as ash rained from the sky... and the cyanobacteria in the water at Zion.) All in all, though, the trip was wonderful! We went to Sequoia, Palm Springs, Ventura beach, Vegas, Zion, the Grand Canyon, and Lake Havasu! The only thing I regret is the fact that after I get back, I have SO MUCH to do it almost feels like the vacation isn't worth the catch-up! I have a very hard time relaxing when I think of all the work I SHOULD do doing. I don't know why I spoil things for myself. :-P\n\nAnyway, if you're here for an easter egg, here's a video where Nate (Baasik) tried to throw me off a tube at Lake Havasu! We often rent a boat when we camp near a lake and we've both gotten pretty good at throwing each other. The trick is to use the whiplash maneuver. It's by FAR the hardest to sustain! Here's the clip! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZlA7Hd7mPw\n\nOk, I gotta sleep because you know how I said I was busy? Well, tomorrow I'm hading to the Wilcox Playa to meet up with some pilot friends and fly for the weekend... Because you know. For work. Wish me luck!\n\nG-nite!\n\n~Gabe"

I do! It might not be very coherent though because I'm... very tired.\nI'm not gonna proofread either so you'll get an unfiltered look into my brain at 4:00am. How exciting for you.\nSo let's see, what's been going on in my life lately?... Well, I've been trying to find a house to buy so I can invest some of my money and have my own place to live while the world slowly starts to return to normal (whatever that means). Problem is that it's been VERY difficult to find a place! I expected the market to be kinda slow considering everything going on, but I was quite wrong. Houses are selling like candy over here! They're literally on the market for a few days before they're gone! I thought about buying my own plot of land and building a house on it, but all the good plots have also been bought up... It's a conspiracy I tells ya... Mcdonalds is buying it. They have a massive expansion planned. McDonald's city. Where every restaurant is a McDonalds and all the retail workers, doctors, mechanics, and teachers dress like clowns. It's coming. Mark my words.\n\nOk... I should probably go to sleep. Before I go though, if you get a sec, please let me know what you think of videos like this. How can I improve them? I'm eager to know since this Song Association series is the first I have ever done that wasn't edited entirely by me. I want to put out more content or y'all but in order to do that, I'm gonna need to start hiring people (like my amazing editor) to help me.\nEaster Egg? Right! Since me and Nate's super old music was teased, here's a video of Nate (Baasik) doing some magic tricks when he was 12. :-P https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XXeUizPJFg\n\nOk, sleeeep is what I must do.

Well, I've been trying to find a house to buy so I can invest some of my money and have my own place to live while the world slowly starts to return to normal (whatever that means). Problem is that it's been VERY difficult to find a place! I expected the market to be kinda slow considering everything going on, but I was quite wrong. Houses are selling like candy over here! They're literally on the market for a few days before they're gone! I thought about buying my own plot of land and building a house on it, but all the good plots have also been bought up... It's a conspiracy I tells ya... Mcdonalds is buying it. They have a massive expansion planned. McDonald's city. Where every restaurant is a McDonalds and all the retail workers, doctors, mechanics, and teachers dress like clowns. It's coming. Mark my words.\n\nOk... I should probably go to sleep. Before I go though, if you get a sec, please let me know what you think of videos like this. How can I improve them? I'm eager to know since this Song Association series is the first I have ever done that wasn't edited entirely by me. I want to put out more content or y'all but in order to do that, I'm gonna need to start hiring people (like my amazing editor) to help me.\nEaster Egg? Right! Since me and Nate's super old music was teased, here's a video of Nate (Baasik) doing some magic tricks when he was 12. :-P https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XXeUizPJFg\n\nOk, sleeeep is what I must do. Goooodninghhgtnhg\n\n~Gabe"

DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!\nI LIIIIIVE!! Man, I usually hate editing, but it's been really fun making this video! I miss doing stuff like this. Nate's in Seattle so obviously it's been pretty difficult making videos together lately, but last week I couldn't resist flying up to see him! We had a great time hanging out, hiking, writing new music, and jumping off of cliffs into water! I'm back in Arizona now though because... I'm house hunting. Yup. I'm looking to buy my first house! It's kinda scary, but also very exciting and a great way to invest! I've been saving a lot of money this year (since, you know, not much to spend it on) and I figured it was a good time to make a REAL investment. I'll keep you posted on the progress as the situation unfolds.\n\nOh, and I'm still planning to move to LA in case anybody was wondering. It just really doesn't make sense to do that now. I have been working on some pretty exciting LA-based projects though! One small positive side to this lockdown is that it's forcing the entertainment industry to be more comfortable with remote recording. Both Claire and I have been booking a lot of work lately. :-)\n\nOk, I guess I should probably drop you a link to a hidden video or something... I was planning on cutting the outtakes from this video into a nice easter egg, but it's currently 5:49am and I'm just now exporting the first draft of GSC6, so... I don't think that's going to happen tonight... or uh, this morning... I'll make it eventually. In the meantime, wanna see me get hit in the face with a water balloon in slow motion? OH GOOD! Here's the video my sister made for our 4th of July party invitation (the smexy Fil-Am is my sister's husband, JR ;-) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYH5Aw856fA\n\nOk, I need sleep before I forget who I am...

Ok ok ok, I REALLY need to fix my blasted sleep schedule... It's 6:25am as I'm typing this and I know by the time I'm done uploading it's gonna be around 7:00am... I still haven't done the thumbnail yet so if it's crappy, that's why... XD\n\nSo hey, I don't know who needs to hear this right now but you are loved and valued and treasured and you matter just as much as everybody you respect and look up to... I don't usually say things like that because I always found it kinda cheesy, but there's a LOT of anger and fear and hatred in the world right now and I feel like this is a good time to spread a positive message. Human value isn't calculated by race, gender or status. It doesn't increase with age or wealth or social standing. It can't be bought with money or boosted with friends. It isn't something you gain with a job title, or loose when you mess up. It's something each and every one of us is born with and it can't be taken away. No matter how many mistakes we make, no matter what people say about us, no matter how much we put ourselves down. We are valuable. In every sense of the word. We may be the only sentient life in the entire universe which makes us remarkably unique and incredibly rare! A physical anomaly and a scientific paradox. The only known anti-entropic collection of atoms in the universe! We create order from chaos. We explore. We create. We dream. We imagine. We invent. We are incredible! And while many of us make mistakes, history has shown that we get there eventually. I truly believe we will continue to grow. As individuals, as communities, as a race, as a species. I have faith in the good of mankind. I have faith in all of you. I believe we are stronger together BECAUSE of our differences, so please remember to tell someone how much they mean to you. Tell somebody you love them and also remember that there are LOTS of people who love you. Dearly. \n\nShew! Ok, that kinda slipped out and I'm too tired to make it pretty, so take it or leave it. :-P\n\nWant an easter egg? Here's a wholesome video of us shooting a milk jug full of water with a potato cannon while Claire enthusiastically reacts in the background! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etdaJfW5W3I\n\nIIIII'm gonna try to go to sleep now.. I mean, after I make the thumbnail. Oof.\n\nHey. Love ya! Seriously..\n\n~Gabe",

I was trying to take a break until things got a bit better but I think instead of waiting for that to happen I should probably be trying to spread some positivity, so that's what I'm gonna do... I hope you enjoy the video!\n\nAnd now... the links and the credits! *I can sound like a pretty convincing duck!*\n\nFilmed and Edited by my amazing Mysterious Associate!

Ok ok ok, I REALLY need to fix my blasted sleep schedule... It's 6:25am as I'm typing this and I know by the time I'm done uploading it's gonna be around 7:00am... I still haven't done the thumbnail yet so if it's crappy, that's why... XD\n\nSo hey, I don't know who needs to hear this right now but you are loved and valued and treasured and you matter just as much as everybody you respect and look up to... I don't usually say things like that because I always found it kinda cheesy, but there's a LOT of anger and fear and hatred in the world right now and I feel like this is a good time to spread a positive message. Human value isn't calculated by race, gender or status. It doesn't increase with age or wealth or social standing. It can't be bought with money or boosted with friends. It isn't something you gain with a job title, or loose when you mess up. It's something each and every one of us is born with and it can't be taken away. No matter how many mistakes we make, no matter what people say about us, no matter how much we put ourselves down. We are valuable. In every sense of the word. We may be the only sentient life in the entire universe which makes us remarkably unique and incredibly rare! A physical anomaly and a scientific paradox. The only known anti-entropic collection of atoms in the universe! We create order from chaos. We explore. We create. We dream. We imagine. We invent. We are incredible! And while many of us make mistakes, history has shown that we get there eventually. I truly believe we will continue to grow. As individuals, as communities, as a race, as a species. I have faith in the good of mankind. I have faith in all of you. I believe we are stronger together BECAUSE of our differences, so please remember to tell someone how much they mean to you. Tell somebody you love them and also remember that there are LOTS of people who love you. Dearly. \n\nShew! Ok, that kinda slipped out and I'm too tired to make it pretty, so take it or leave it. :-P\n\nWant an easter egg? Here's a wholesome video of us shooting a milk jug full of water with a potato cannon while Claire enthusiastically reacts in the background! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etdaJfW5W3I\n\nIIIII'm gonna try to go to sleep now.. I mean, after I make the thumbnail. Oof.\n\nHey. Love ya! Seriously..\n\n~Gabe"

DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!\n\nOk, oh my, oh dear, I'm tired...\n\nI really wanted to get a video out last week but things are not going super smoothly over here... I'd complain about it, but I know that many people are worse off than I am, so I'm just gonna say I'm thankful to be in good health. I don't know how many of you need to hear this but things are not always as bad as they seem... Yes, there is a \"new\" virus spreading around the world and it's extremely contagious, but it's most likely not going to kill you... The quarantine exists to keep it from spreading so quickly that it overwhelms hospitals. Of course the elderly and immunocompromised are at higher risk, but keep in mind they are ALWAYS at higher risk. From ANY infection. It's always a good practice to social distance/quarantine yourself if you know you're sick, ESPECIALLY from people who are more likely to get extremely ill from diseases that a person with a healthy immune system would have an easier time fighting off...\n\nI'm not saying we shouldn't be responsible and do whatever we can to prevent the spread of COVID-19 before there is a vaccine available to the general public, but we can be smart and cautious without panicking... Being so scared that you rush to the doctor whenever you sneeze, or hoarding all the toilet paper and hand sanitizer is NOT helping. In fact, it's making things worse. Remember, we still have a lot to learn about this virus. The symptoms are very mild for most so that makes it easy to spread and difficult to detect, but it also means there are likely a lot more people infected than have been tested and, while that sounds scary, it would also mean that the death rate could be a lot lower than the current estimated 3%. (This is my opinion so take it with a grain of salt. The death rate could also be higher, or the same, I'm just trying to think about this optimistically because I don't believe constant pessimism is good for people's mental health. We are bombarded with enough negativity every single day, we KNOW the bad news. Why not introduce some levity and a positive spin? If you find yourself stressing out about this, stop reading updates for a while. Turn off the TV. Put your phone away. Obsessing over something you can't control doesn't fix anything, it only makes you more miserable.)\n\nObviously, we should take this seriously, but we also shouldn't freak out.. This is not a zombie apocalypse. Most of the people who get it will recover completely in under 10 days. If we continue to wash our hands and social distance when possible, we will get through this with minimal casualties. Stay smart. Stay positive. Stay hopeful. Don't panic. :-)\n\nIf you want to stay up to date on COVID-19 data without the sensationalism of mainstream and social media, here's a website that is updated daily: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ (add \"/country/us\" to the URL for US-specific numbers)\n\nOk, I gotta go to sleep or I'm gonna die of exhaustion before I even have a chance to GET sick...\n\nI love you all!\n\n~Gabe\n\n#COVID19 #CreativeQuarantine",

DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!\n\nOk, oh my, oh dear, I'm tired...\n\nI really wanted to get a video out last week but things are not going super smoothly over here... I'd complain about it, but I know that many people are worse off than I am, so I'm just gonna say I'm thankful to be in good health. I don't know how many of you need to hear this but things are not always as bad as they seem... Yes, there is a \"new\" virus spreading around the world and it's extremely contagious, but it's most likely not going to kill you... The quarantine exists to keep it from spreading so quickly that it overwhelms hospitals. Of course the elderly and immunocompromised are at higher risk, but keep in mind they are ALWAYS at higher risk. From ANY infection. It's always a good practice to social distance/quarantine yourself if you know you're sick, ESPECIALLY from people who are more likely to get extremely ill from diseases that a person with a healthy immune system would have an easier time fighting off...\n\nI'm not saying we shouldn't be responsible and do whatever we can to prevent the spread of COVID-19 before there is a vaccine available to the general public, but we can be smart and cautious without panicking... Being so scared that you rush to the doctor whenever you sneeze, or hoarding all the toilet paper and hand sanitizer is NOT helping. In fact, it's making things worse. Remember, we still have a lot to learn about this virus. The symptoms are very mild for most so that makes it easy to spread and difficult to detect, but it also means there are likely a lot more people infected than have been tested and, while that sounds scary, it would also mean that the death rate could be a lot lower than the current estimated 3%. (This is my opinion so take it with a grain of salt. The death rate could also be higher, or the same, I'm just trying to think about this optimistically because I don't believe constant pessimism is good for people's mental health. We are bombarded with enough negativity every single day, we KNOW the bad news. Why not introduce some levity and a positive spin? If you find yourself stressing out about this, stop reading updates for a while. Turn off the TV. Put your phone away. Obsessing over something you can't control doesn't fix anything, it only makes you more miserable.)\n\nObviously, we should take this seriously, but we also shouldn't freak out.. This is not a zombie apocalypse. Most of the people who get it will recover completely in under 10 days. If we continue to wash our hands and social distance when possible, we will get through this with minimal casualties. Stay smart. Stay positive. Stay hopeful. Don't panic. :-)\n\nIf you want to stay up to date on COVID-19 data without the sensationalism of mainstream and social media, here's a website that is updated daily: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ (add \"/country/us\" to the URL for US-specific numbers)\n\nOk, I gotta go to sleep or I'm gonna die of exhaustion before I even have a chance to GET sick...\n\nI love you all!\n\n~Gabe\n\n#COVID19 #CreativeQuarantine"

I'm currently in Tucson but I'm headed back to LA in the morning for a few meetings with Steve Oedekerk and his agents, then I'm off to Amsterdam for Hearth's Warming Con! Should be fun! I've never been to the Netherlands before!\n\nAlso... TOMORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY!! O_O I'm turning... 30... I can't believe it. I always thought 30-year-olds were old and it snuck up on me SO FAST! I guess I have to start hating modern music now... Oh wait, I already do.\n\nBTW, Last weekend I was at the Arizona Flying Circus with my flying buddy Dan and my friend Marcy and it was INCREDIBLE!! I made a quick highlight reel if you're curious, check it out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtjCWufxR9E\n\nOH YEAH! And one more thing before I try to take a quick nap... I got contacted by the Fine Bros yesterday and invited to be on YouTubers React!! It sounds like a total blast and I can't wait to do it!\n\nOk, I guess that's it... Thanks for always reading this far, DDR's. You make me happy. :-)\n\n~Gabe"

I know I keep saying that, but I'm too picky to actually do it...

I'm heading to the Arizona Flying Circus tomorrow morning (I'll already be there by the time you read this). It's a pilots get together in the middle of nowhere and lemme tell ya... It's pretty crazy! Here's a highlight video made by my friend Dan. I think I show up in it a few times: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0tVRrTnYts\n\nOH GUESS WHAT! I finally have an Anual Pass for Disney Land! WOO! I feel like I'm one step closer to living in LA (thanks Claire ^-^)! We also went on Rise of the Resistance and MAN was it cool! Such a unique experience! Even getting ON the ride was exciting! We had to get into the park before it opened and then refresh the app right at 8:00am to reserve our spot! The competition was fierce! So many people were trying to get their place that the app was freezing up. After about a minute we started hearing cheers from people who successfully reserved their spot. By the time the app registered our attempt, it was 8:01 and we were group 57!! We didn't get to ride until 3:30pm but the people who waited until 8:04 didn't get to ride at all...Here's a video of that chaos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMekcXzq2Fo\n\nI did the math, there were about 30 people to a group and less than 100 groups were admitted that day. It had only been opened for 18 days so that means by the time we went on it, less than 60,000 people had been on that ride since the day it opened! I felt very exclusive!

DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!\n\nGOOOOOOD MORNING! (No, not Vietnam.)\nYes, that's correct, I've been up all night again. In fact, lately, I've been kinda nocturnal... It usually happens when I have a lot to work on. I always work better at night because there aren't as many distractions and I usually feel more focussed. Anyway, It's currently 7:47am (cool! I love jets!) and I'll probably be going to sleep in the next 30 minutes... Oh, that sounds niiice! ^-^\n\nAnyway, I really hope you liked this video! It was kinda hard to make, but it was also a lot of fun! If it does well, I'll definitely be making more but I might not make them as long. My theory is that most people don't watch to the end anyway and it doesn't make much of a difference if the videos are shorter than 10 minutes (at least as far as my channel is concerned). If I made shorter videos I might be able to upload more often! Hmm.. I need an editor. Sorry, thinking out loud again. I'm glad I can type quickly. I used to hate writing in school because my thoughts moved so much faster than my pencil. I remember when I taught myself to type I actually started to enjoy writing! I still don't do it the right way but I'm fast enough that I don't care.\n\nOH GUESS WHAT! I'm heading to LA again in a few weeks and there's a good chance I'll be meeting up with Roomie to do a video (and maybe a whole series! We haven't decided yet.) Looking forward to that as I've wanted to do more collabs this year.\n\nOh, you want an easter egg? Have you heard this cover of \"The Song Of The White Wolf\" that I did with Samuel Kim? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxFuQ6xRudw\nI got to know him through my work with Daniel Ingram. He produces for Daniel a lot and he's super talented and cool! You should totally subscribe to him!\n\nOk.... I really need to sleep... I love you all! Thanks for your continued support!!\n\n~Gabe",

Woo! Sooo, it's currently 7:56am and that's because I didn't start working on this video until midnight... In my defense though, a LOT has happened!!!\nFor one, New Years... It was AWESOME but it was also CRAZY!! It was 1920s themed (I guess a lot of people did that) and we had a BUNCH of people over! Claire Corlett came too! (Ask her how to crack a pecan shell, she can tell you all about it. XP) Here's a clip of the fireworks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzISm39EZfM\nThe party was awesome! But the craziest part was that my sister Zanna got ENGAGED!!! O0O\nSooo, the wedding is in March and we have a LOT to do to get ready for it!\n\nIn other news, my brother Nate (Baasik) decided he doesn't want to move to LA after all, but I am still planning to go so it's been kinda crazy lately trying to figure out what I'm going to do since I'll no longer be splitting rent with my brother... Anybody in LA looking for a roommate? :-3\n\nOh yeah, I had an AMAZING PPG flight a few days ago! Flew over a boneyard and got to see my dad's airplane (Boeing 747-400) super up close and personal! Check out this video by my buddy, Dan! (I'm the black, blue and green wing) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-n6h4lgleM&list=LLvzWGXYFDiiJ338KIJPhbhQ\n\nOk, I really need to sleep.

I didn't like the outro I did on take 2, so there IS a hidden video cut right at the end of the song...

Woo! Sooo, it's currently 7:56am and that's because I didn't start working on this video until midnight... In my defense though, a LOT has happened!!!\nFor one, New Years... It was AWESOME but it was also CRAZY!! It was 1920s themed (I guess a lot of people did that) and we had a BUNCH of people over! Claire Corlett came too! (Ask her how to crack a pecan shell, she can tell you all about it. XP) Here's a clip of the fireworks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzISm39EZfM\nThe party was awesome! But the craziest part was that my sister Zanna got ENGAGED!!! O0O\nSooo, the wedding is in March and we have a LOT to do to get ready for it!\n\nIn other news, my brother Nate (Baasik) decided he doesn't want to move to LA after all, but I am still planning to go so it's been kinda crazy lately trying to figure out what I'm going to do since I'll no longer be splitting rent with my brother... Anybody in LA looking for a roommate? :-3\n\nOh yeah, I had an AMAZING PPG flight a few days ago! Flew over a boneyard and got to see my dad's airplane (Boeing 747-400) super up close and personal! Check out this video by my buddy, Dan! (I'm the black, blue and green wing) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-n6h4lgleM&list=LLvzWGXYFDiiJ338KIJPhbhQ\n\nOk, I really need to sleep. It's weird, I'm not even tired but I know as soon as I lay down I'll sleep for 10 hours. \n\n~Gabo"

I was gonna do a cover of \"Into The Unknown\" from Frozen 2 but I just had NO motivation... I mean, I love the song, don't get me wrong! But it's a lot of work to memorize, dress up, and then sing it over and over again until I get a perfect take, and then to have it demonetized every single time is just... Kinda disheartening...\nSo I thought about it a while... I wanna put out videos more often but I've been so busy with outside projects lately that I just don't have time. Then I had an idea! This idea!\nAnyway, I really hope you like it! If you do, it will certainly make my life easier, and I'll be able to put out content more often! Plus, it's really fun because I get to let more of my personality show as none of this is scripted! WOO!\n\nOH HEY! BTW! Didja notice I'm in YouTube Rewind this year?! Weird... I got an email from them a few weeks ago, telling me that I had one of the most liked creator videos of 2019 and I was honestly very surprised! 3.5 million likes doesn't SEEM like that much, but I guess it is! I wonder if we can break that record next year... Hmmmmm....\n\nAnyway, you probably want an easter egg, right? Ok, how about this!\nMy friend and flying buddy Dan Toborowski made a pretty awesome highlight reel of some of his more epic flights this year!

I was gonna do a cover of \"Into The Unknown\" from Frozen 2 but I just had NO motivation... I mean, I love the song, don't get me wrong! But it's a lot of work to memorize, dress up, and then sing it over and over again until I get a perfect take, and then to have it demonetized every single time is just... Kinda disheartening...\nSo I thought about it a while... I wanna put out videos more often but I've been so busy with outside projects lately that I just don't have time. Then I had an idea! This idea!\nAnyway, I really hope you like it! If you do, it will certainly make my life easier, and I'll be able to put out content more often! Plus, it's really fun because I get to let more of my personality show as none of this is scripted! WOO!\n\nOH HEY! BTW! Didja notice I'm in YouTube Rewind this year?! Weird... I got an email from them a few weeks ago, telling me that I had one of the most liked creator videos of 2019 and I was honestly very surprised! 3.5 million likes doesn't SEEM like that much, but I guess it is! I wonder if we can break that record next year... Hmmmmm....\n\nAnyway, you probably want an easter egg, right? Ok, how about this!\nMy friend and flying buddy Dan Toborowski made a pretty awesome highlight reel of some of his more epic flights this year! I'm in a bunch of the clips (look for the green, blue, and black wing) Check it! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsTHsnM_R0I\n\nOk, well it's 5:59am and I need sleeeeeeppppp, so...\n\nNIGHTY NIGHT BUBBLE HEADS!\n\n~Gabe"

Recorded in Audacity on my AT2020 mic, filmed on my Canon Vixia camera and synched up in Adobe Premiere. No tuning, or video cuts. (I usually record late in the afternoon but I actually recorded this one in the morning since Frollo's voice is so darn low! :-P)\n\n\nAnd now, the links and credits! *want a potato chip?*\n\n\nPLEASE SUBSCRIBE! https://www.youtube.com/c/BlackGryph0n\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/BlackGryph0n\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BlackGryph0n\n\nInstigram: https://www.instagram.com/blackgryph0n/\n\n\nBuisnes Inquires: GabrielBrownInfo@gmail.com\n\n\nBacking Track available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFQXEtAe6p4\n\n\n- -- --- ---- Lyrics ---- --- -- -\n\n\nBeata Maria\nYou know I am a righteous man, Of my virtue, I am justly proud\nBeata Maria\nYou know I'm so much purer than the common, vulgar, weak, Licentious crowd \n\nThen tell me, Maria, why I see her dancing there\nWhy her smoldering eyes still scorch my soul \n\nI feel her, I see her\nThe sun caught in her raven hair is blazing in me out of all control \n\nLike fire! Hellfire! This fire in my skin\nThis burning desire is turning me to sin \n\nIt's not my fault! I'm not to blame!\nIt is the gypsy girl, the witch who sent this flame \nIt's not my fault if in God's plan \nHe made the devil so much stronger than a man\n\nProtect me, Maria\nDon't let this siren cast her spell\nDon't let her fire sear my flesh and bone\nDestroy Esmeralda\nAnd let her taste the fires of hell\nOr else let her be mine and mine alone \n\nHellfire! Dark fire\nNow gypsy, it's your turn\nChoose me or your pyre\nBe mine or you will burn \n\nGod have mercy on her \nGod have mercy on me \nBut she will be mine or she will burn!\n\n\n- -- --- ---- End ---- --- -- -\n\n\n\n\nHELLO DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!\nYAY! It's 4:38am! Can I be honest with you? I'm getting kinda sick of doing covers... I mean, I originally started doing them because they were relatively easy and were a good way to keep uploading videos even if I got busy, but lately, I just haven't been motivated to do them...\nThat said, I actually have a BUNCH of ideas for new videos, I'm just not sure how well they'll be received. As much as I like singing, it feels like a job and I'd love to have fun on YouTube again! Reversify was fun! We're definitely gonna do more of those, but I wanna do a LOT of videos like that! Both with my brother, and solo!\nSoooooo... If any of you have something you'd like to see me do, please let me know!! I'm DEFINITELY open to new ideas!\n\nOh BTW, I'm working on a massive collab with MrBeast and a bunch of others. I'll hopefully have it done by next friday so keep an eye out for that!\nWe're also just a few weeks away from Ciderfest which I'm SUPER looking forward too! I'm not going as a VIP this year so I won't be on a lot of panels or signing autographs, but I WILL be doing a show on Friday night and wandering around the convention center with my friends. If you see me, come say hi! :-)\n\nOH YEAH! And in case you haven't seen it yet, here's the trailer for the \"Thumb Wars\" movie I'm in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_XpOM667A\nI play 5 characters in this and it was an absolute BLAST to shoot! Steve Oedekerk is a brilliant and hilarious guy and I'm super glad to know him!\n\nOh, and if you've already seen the Thumb Wars trailer, here's a bitter-sweet \"growing up\" montage my awesome sister Susanna made for our family! (It's on my Dad's YouTube channel, so stop by and say hi! He'd love that!) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg2hWkh5f10\n\nOk, I'm tired.... Goodnighithdjfnkl\n\n~Gabeeee",

He's a brilliant, hilarious, kind-hearted guy and it was an absolute blast working with him! He sent me the trailer yesterday and it's ridiculously, stupidly funny (to be expected from the guy behind Ace Ventura, Bruce Almighty, and Kung Pow)! I don't think I'm allowed to share the trailer yet, but I'm hoping to have it for y'all as soon as I get back from LA! WOOOO!\n\nOops, I lied again! I AM allowed to share it with y'all!\nHere it is!

DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!\n\nSo, THIS was a fun video! Right? Did you like it? Do you have any ideas that you think will make it better? I know we have a bunch of ideas but I have no idea if we're even gonna make another video like this. People might hate it! It is pretty weird. XP\nAnyway, it's only 2:57am right now which is SUPER early for me! O_O I'm probably gonna take a shower after I upload this video. Not because I need one, because I WANT one. It's relaxing, dang it.\n\nOh, BTW, I'm heading to LA this weekend to hang out with some friends and also to discuss a very cool project with a very cool person! I don't think I'm allowed to tell you about it yet, but I'll be posting updates VERY soon!\n\nOk, wait, I just checked and I AM allowed to tell you, so here you go!\n\nI shot a VERY fun movie with legendary screenwriter/director Steve Oedekerk! He's a brilliant, hilarious, kind-hearted guy and it was an absolute blast working with him! He sent me the trailer yesterday and it's ridiculously, stupidly funny (to be expected from the guy behind Ace Ventura, Bruce Almighty, and Kung Pow)! I don't think I'm allowed to share the trailer yet, but I'm hoping to have it for y'all as soon as I get back from LA! WOOOO!\n\nOops, I lied again! I AM allowed to share it with y'all!\nHere it is! I play 6 of the characters (one of which is in the trailer)! can you guess which one? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy_XpOM667A&feature=youtu.be\n\nOk, SHAWAAA TIME!!!\n\n~Gabe"

I'll probably hate this cover in a few weeks, once I learn the song better. That usually happens once I really memorize the song and start to notice the more subtle nuances in the voices and instrumentation. I can already hear one thing I wish I did differently... I'm singing \"about - you\" and Shawn sings it more like \"aboud-a-you\" assigning an extra note to the \"a\" that I omit when I sing with a space in between the \"about\" and the \"you\". Oh well, I'll do it better at Karaoke next time. :-P\n\nSo Nate and I were gonna try to do Genre Switching Challenge 5 this weekend, but we had to push it back for a few reasons, the coolest of which is that my friend Claire Corlett is here from LA! I Don't get to see her very often but we're pretty close so it's cool when I get too. :-) She's here for a little over a week to record an EP she's writing, and also to explore the desert. Gonna take her shooting tomorrow if it doesn't rain (don't worry, I'm not gonna kill Sweetie Belle).\n\nOk, now for an easter egg... OK, how about this, here's a video of Claire and I playing Ping Pong. Riveting, I know. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg8qM-c_v80\n\nOk, it's 6:08am and the sun is coming up, so that means it's time for bed!\n\nG'nite\n\n~Gabo",

Support goes towards producing new music: https://www.patreon.com/BlackGryph0n \n\n-- THIS IS MIC I USE: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0145OGS7U/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0145OGS7U&linkCode=as2&tag=blackgryph0n-20&linkId=018ddfb82db517b338d0fecf3a002cff\n\nThis is my 6th take. Recorded in Audacity on my AT2020 mic, filmed on my Canon Vixia camera and synched up in Adobe Premiere. No tuning, or video cuts. (I was actually pretty happy with my 3rd take, but I had a bunch of facial hair and I couldn't decide if I should keep it for the cover, or lose it... so I filmed 5 times with scruff and once without. :-P)\n\n\nAnd now, the links and credits! *want a potato chip?*\n\n\nPLEASE SUBSCRIBE! https://www.youtube.com/c/BlackGryph0n\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/BlackGryph0n\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BlackGryph0n\n\nInstigram: https://www.instagram.com/blackgryph0n/\n\n\nBuisnes Inquires: GabrielBrownInfo@gmail.com\n\n\nBacking Track available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyqDjiAMidc\n\n\n- -- --- ---- Lyrics ---- --- -- -\n\n\nI can't write one song that's not about you\nCan't drink without thinkin' about you\nIs it too late to tell you that\nEverything means nothing if I can't have you?\n\nI'm in Toronto and I've got this view\nBut I might as well be in a hotel room, yeah\nIt doesn't matter 'cause I'm so consumed\nSpending all my nights reading texts from you\n\nOh, I'm good at keepin' my distance\nI know that you're the feelin' I'm missing\nYou know that I hate to admit it\nBut everything means nothin' if I can't have you\n\nCHORUS X2\n\nI'm so sorry that my timing's off\nBut I can't move on if we're still gonna talk\nIs it wrong for me to not want half?\nI want all of you, all the strings attached\n\nOh, I'm good at keepin' my distance\nI know that you're the feelin' I'm missing\nYou know that I hate to admit it\nBut everything means nothin' if I can't have you\n\nCHORUS X2\n\nI'm trying to move on\nForget you, but I hold on\n(Everything means nothing, Everything means nothing, babe)\nI'm trying to move on\nForget you, but I hold on\nEverything means nothing if I can't have you\n\nCHORUS X2\n\n\n- -- --- ---- End ---- --- -- -\n\n\n\n\nHELLO DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!\nI literally first heard this song about a day before I recorded it.. I'll probably hate this cover in a few weeks, once I learn the song better. That usually happens once I really memorize the song and start to notice the more subtle nuances in the voices and instrumentation. I can already hear one thing I wish I did differently... I'm singing \"about - you\" and Shawn sings it more like \"aboud-a-you\" assigning an extra note to the \"a\" that I omit when I sing with a space in between the \"about\" and the \"you\". Oh well, I'll do it better at Karaoke next time. :-P\n\nSo Nate and I were gonna try to do Genre Switching Challenge 5 this weekend, but we had to push it back for a few reasons, the coolest of which is that my friend Claire Corlett is here from LA! I Don't get to see her very often but we're pretty close so it's cool when I get too. :-) She's here for a little over a week to record an EP she's writing, and also to explore the desert. Gonna take her shooting tomorrow if it doesn't rain (don't worry, I'm not gonna kill Sweetie Belle).\n\nOk, now for an easter egg... OK, how about this, here's a video of Claire and I playing Ping Pong. Riveting, I know. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg8qM-c_v80\n\nOk, it's 6:08am and the sun is coming up, so that means it's time for bed!\n\nG'nite\n\n~Gabo"

Turns out there were some very crucial parts that were either not filmed, fell on a crossfade from the broadcast, or I messed up the lyrics (twice) so I had to find a LOT of clips from other songs, then stretch them to fit... Also, there was a dude with an infinity gauntlet with his hand up for the whole show. And it looked awesome! It really did! But, uh, it kinda ruined a lot of shots because the glowing infinity stones were pretty distracting... So I actually had to mask out the stones, frame by frame, in two different shots. It was fun! Yeah, that's it! FUN! I'm still having fun! I'm not tired, it's just a state of mind. I'm thinking very clearly right now I'm not disy at all and I'm not giving up on punctuation and sentince structure and spelling because im tired I just don't feel like it right now ok I can do what I want don't judge.\n\nANYWAY, I didn't have time to export a mini-vlog, but fortunately for me, I didn't need to make one, because JEFF did!

I'M TIRED!! I know, crazy right?! It's currently 4:43 am as I'm typing this and it'll probably be another hour before I'm in bed, but it's worth it!\n\nA few days ago, Nate and I got back from shooting a music video in Mexico. We went Jetskiing, Parasailing, and ATVing in under 24 hours and it was CRAZY!! Lots of fun but we're exhausted. We were gonna take a break but I didn't think it would be a good idea to ONLY put out original music for the next few weeks, so we made this Genre Switching cover. Fortunately, Hip-Hop is pretty easy to produce so it didn't take us very long. I hope you like it!\n\nAs many of you may know, we're performing songs from our new album (and selling CD's) at BronyCon in Baltimore on August 3rd! Our show is Saturday Night and we're REALLY looking forward to it!! We'll also be shooting a music video for our new song \"Better\" during the performance, so I really hope to see y'all there!\n\nOk, it's Easter Egg time! Lets seeeee, what haven't I posted yet...\nOH YEAH!! Have you seen the MLP covers I've been doing with Daniel Ingram? We recorded a bunch of covers at his awesome home studio in Vancouver before driving down to attend Everfree Northwest in Seattle! Here's a particularly challenging one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvNTItLMSxs&list=LLvzWGXYFDiiJ338KIJPhbhQ\n\nOH, LAST THING! After BronyCon we'll be making another #GenreSwitching challenge, so yay! I know a lot of you wanted that. :-)\n\nOk, well I'd better go to bed before I start shlipng ondud fodfjfaazzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz\n\n~Gabe",

I'M TIRED!! I know, crazy right?! It's currently 4:43 am as I'm typing this and it'll probably be another hour before I'm in bed, but it's worth it!\n\nA few days ago, Nate and I got back from shooting a music video in Mexico. We went Jetskiing, Parasailing, and ATVing in under 24 hours and it was CRAZY!! Lots of fun but we're exhausted. We were gonna take a break but I didn't think it would be a good idea to ONLY put out original music for the next few weeks, so we made this Genre Switching cover. Fortunately, Hip-Hop is pretty easy to produce so it didn't take us very long. I hope you like it!\n\nAs many of you may know, we're performing songs from our new album (and selling CD's) at BronyCon in Baltimore on August 3rd! Our show is Saturday Night and we're REALLY looking forward to it!! We'll also be shooting a music video for our new song \"Better\" during the performance, so I really hope to see y'all there!\n\nOk, it's Easter Egg time! Lets seeeee, what haven't I posted yet...\nOH YEAH!! Have you seen the MLP covers I've been doing with Daniel Ingram? We recorded a bunch of covers at his awesome home studio in Vancouver before driving down to attend Everfree Northwest in Seattle! Here's a particularly challenging one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvNTItLMSxs&list=LLvzWGXYFDiiJ338KIJPhbhQ\n\nOH, LAST THING! After BronyCon we'll be making another #GenreSwitching challenge, so yay! I know a lot of you wanted that. :-)\n\nOk, well I'd better go to bed before I start shlipng ondud fodfjfaazzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz\n\n~Gabe"

DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!\nDang, Hawaii was amazing as usual but this trip was particularly crazy! First, we stayed at Disney's Aulani Resort for the 4th of July to watch the fireworks: https://twitter.com/BlackGryph0n/status/1147053503220613120\nThen we went to the north shore and stayed in a house on the beach. LOTS of snorkeling and LOTS of sunburn! I also rescued a juvenile sea turtle that was stranded in a tiny hot tidepool after the tide went out. I WON'T be showing you that video, however, as I don't want to get fined for touching a sea turtle. :-P Instead, here's a few clips of my favorite snorkeling spot in Oahu! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MgILjSgr0k\n\nI also saw a Whitetip Reef Shark during the day which I wasn't expecting as they're mostly nocturnal. :-P I got a video of that too, but it's on my Dad's camera so I won't be able to post it until I get the camera from him. It'll probably be in the music video for our next single \"Let Down\" coming next Friday! :-D\n\nOk, it's 5:45am and I need to go to sleep because we're watching Spider-Man tomorrow and I wanna be alert so I can help him fight bad-guys in case he asks us to help him fight bad-guys.\n\nLove y'all!\n\n~Gabe",

My tourist look is on point!\n\nI spent most of the day filming for the next music video \"Letdown\" coming July 19th. I also rescued a young sea-turtle from a tiny overheating tide-pool today but IDK if I can share that footage without people going all \"ANIMAL CRUELTY\" on me. XP\n\nOH! So when I was cutting the footage together I ended up with a crap ton of unused footage that I randomly happened to play after exporting the music vid and it was kinda fun! So I bounced about half of it into what I'm calling a \"Mini-vlog\"\nIt was pretty easy, so I might do one of these for every music video if y'all like it! Lemme know what you think!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7MwkHGAjNA&feature=youtu.be\n\nOK, I gotta go watch some fireworks now. Love y'all and happy 4th!!

If you get it right, we'll send you a link to download the album for free, as well as a congratulations video! Good luck!\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BzGrX8Wg_ZJ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\n\nWe shot this video while moving Baasik's stuff from Mississippi to Arizona! As you can see, it was a pretty hectic move but the party at the end was worth it!

My tourist look is on point!\n\nI spent most of the day filming for the next music video \"Letdown\" coming July 19th. I also rescued a young sea-turtle from a tiny overheating tide-pool today but IDK if I can share that footage without people going all \"ANIMAL CRUELTY\" on me. XP\n\nOH! So when I was cutting the footage together I ended up with a crap ton of unused footage that I randomly happened to play after exporting the music vid and it was kinda fun! So I bounced about half of it into what I'm calling a \"Mini-vlog\"\nIt was pretty easy, so I might do one of these for every music video if y'all like it! Lemme know what you think!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7MwkHGAjNA&feature=youtu.be\n\nOK, I gotta go watch some fireworks now. Love y'all and happy 4th!! (Even though it's definitely not the 4th when you're reading this...)\nhttps://twitter.com/BlackGryph0n/status/1147053503220613120\n\n~Gabe"

DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!\nOk, WOW! This video was REALLY HARD TO MAKE! So, here's the deal. I was PLANNING on releasing this last week but when I got back from Everfree Northwest, I was greeted by a computer that wouldn't boot. Now, I'm not completely clueless when it comes to computers but I tried EVERY TRICK I know and I couldn't get it beyond the BIOS. Finally, I took it into a local computer repair shop thinking I had some damaged hardware or something, and I was informed that my OS (Windows 7) had basically eaten itself. The drive had to be completely wiped and a new OS installed! They went with Windows 10 so, not only did I need to reinstall all my software and create all my presets and templates from scratch, but I also had to learn a new operating system. I THOUGHT about filming a quick impression video on my iPhone, but I HAPPENED to drop it a few days prior and it broke! Good excuse to get an XS, but REALLY bad timing...\n\nAnyway, I'm in Mississippipispsipsi with my brother now and the album is coming along GREAT! We're hoping to have the first single posted to YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music, iTunes, etc. in a few weeks! Definitely before the end of June! WOO!\n\nOH! I also have a super secret, super cool project with a super cool dude in LA sometime this month! Details are fuzzy ATM and I signed an NDA so that's pretty much all I can say about it, but I can't wait for y'all to see it! Should be super cool!\n\nHEY, want an easter egg? How about some highlight footage from this AWESOME flight me and my friend Dan did over the mountains near my neighborhood! This was one of the best PPG flights I've ever had!! We're on comms the whole time but I don't have his audio, so just pretend I'm talking to myself. :-P \nhttps://youtu.be/3Koc_4NheTk\n\nOk, that's all I have time for. The sun is rising so that's my cue to go to sleep. ;-P\n\nLove youuuuuuu!\n\n~Gabe",

DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!\nOk, WOW! This video was REALLY HARD TO MAKE! So, here's the deal. I was PLANNING on releasing this last week but when I got back from Everfree Northwest, I was greeted by a computer that wouldn't boot. Now, I'm not completely clueless when it comes to computers but I tried EVERY TRICK I know and I couldn't get it beyond the BIOS. Finally, I took it into a local computer repair shop thinking I had some damaged hardware or something, and I was informed that my OS (Windows 7) had basically eaten itself. The drive had to be completely wiped and a new OS installed! They went with Windows 10 so, not only did I need to reinstall all my software and create all my presets and templates from scratch, but I also had to learn a new operating system. I THOUGHT about filming a quick impression video on my iPhone, but I HAPPENED to drop it a few days prior and it broke! Good excuse to get an XS, but REALLY bad timing...\n\nAnyway, I'm in Mississippipispsipsi with my brother now and the album is coming along GREAT! We're hoping to have the first single posted to YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music, iTunes, etc. in a few weeks! Definitely before the end of June! WOO!\n\nOH! I also have a super secret, super cool project with a super cool dude in LA sometime this month! Details are fuzzy ATM and I signed an NDA so that's pretty much all I can say about it, but I can't wait for y'all to see it! Should be super cool!\n\nHEY, want an easter egg? How about some highlight footage from this AWESOME flight me and my friend Dan did over the mountains near my neighborhood! This was one of the best PPG flights I've ever had!! We're on comms the whole time but I don't have his audio, so just pretend I'm talking to myself. :-P \nhttps://youtu.be/3Koc_4NheTk\n\nOk, that's all I have time for. The sun is rising so that's my cue to go to sleep. ;-P\n\nLove youuuuuuu!\n\n~Gabe"

Back from Hawaii and BOY was it crazy! What an adventure! The Browns are the coolest family (not us, the other Browns that I stayed with) Crazy talented, funny and humble! It was a pleasure seeing the island with them! I also hung with a local dude named Sage. He showed me all the cool non-touristy spots in Kauai! Almost killed me, too. ;-P\n\nOk, it wasn't his fault, but he took me to a place where the surf is SUPER high and if you're dumb enough to go swimming, the only way to get out is to ride a wave back to the top of the 20-foot cliff you jumped off of. If you screw it up you either get scraped up by the rocks or drown. I didn't screw it up and managed to get out, but then another HUGE wave took me right back off and tossed me around a few minutes... It was pretty gnarly. Honestly, I thought I was going to drown, but I managed to fight the riptide long enough to climb out onto a shallower spot a few hundred feet away from where I fell. When I climbed out of the water, I found a lava rock about the size of a grape embedded in my heel. My right leg was pretty scraped up too. Most of the scratches are healed now, but a few were pretty deep and are still pretty painful. I probably should have gotten stitches but it was hard to tell at the time. Anyway, I'm alive and that's good. :-)\n\nOH! You want an easter egg, don't you?! I mean, it's only fitting so close to easter! Here's a video for one of the songs I sang in the Easter show. (These songs were written by an 18-year-old if you can believe it... I feel old.) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrnJ5B0tXP4\n\nAnd in case you missed the link at the top of the description, here's the latest demo from me and Nate's new album! (Nobody has guessed the name of the album yet, but we have left a lot of hints in a lot of secret places. If you look hard enough, you'll figure it out. ;-) https://youtu.be/_gOkqT1FYg0\n\nOk, time for me to put my face on a pillow until I forget what words mean.\n\n'Till next time!!\n\n~Gabe\n\n#Broadway #YouWillBeFound",

DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!\n\nYou GUYYYYS, I'm so tired!! I bit off more than I can chew this time! :-P\nI'm currently sitting in a garage in Kauai, using an external monitor because my laptop monitor died. By the time you read this, I'll be on the beach shooting a music video at for \"His Story\" the musical. Later tonight, I'm doing a show and I'm gonna be honest with y'all... I don't remember the lyrics. I have about 4 songs to memorize between posting this video and doing the show! :-P\n\nI wish you guys could come and see it, cause it's gonna be pretty cool, but since you can't, here's some of the music from His Story: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY_9PL_YbK8\n\nOh yes and ALSO also, if you want more easter eggs than just that since Easter is coming up, here are some bloopers and things I didn't want to cut from this video but had too because it would have been way too long otherwise... https://youtu.be/PlhoONSwb00\n\nI hope you enjoy me and Nate's shanananananagins. We have a lot of fun! I honestly can't WAIT for him to get out of the Navy and for you to hear our new album! I think you're really gonna like it! (At least I hope so. :-P)\n\nNightynight!\n\n~Gabe\n\n\n#GenreSwitchingChallenge"

DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!\n\nTBH, I've been in a pretty frustrating situation lately... 8 of my top ten videos have been flagged for copyrighted content... (Including the new one with 18,000,000 views that I just uploaded last Friday.) This has been a MAJOR blow to my revenue and on top of that, I'm not even sure it's legal! Our Genre Switching videos and my impressions don't use any pre-recorded content and are only a few seconds long, so they should DEFINITELY fall under fair use as they both transformative AND parody, right?... But clearly, that doesn't matter to the people who flagged my videos because there's money to be had... I've tried disputing all the claims and they have all been denied with no reason given.\n\nI've been pretty upset about it because this is a huge chunk of my livelihood and I put countless hours into making these videos, so to have them completely demonetized means that if I don't get this resolved or figure something out soon, I'm gonna have to stop doing this and get another job so I can pay my rent.\n\nAnyway, if any of you have any ideas or connections who might be able to shed some light on a permanent solution, any suggestions would be very much appreciated! I love what I do and would REALLY love to continue doing it!\n\nOn the positive side, my new video has brought a lot of new people to my channel, so if you're one of them, WELCOME!! I hope you enjoy! Here's an easter egg! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmZdJIx6cmU (It's a clip from a very fun low-level flight. similar to my last easter egg, but uncut... I wanted to have something else for you guys, but alas, I must fight the demonetization demons... Wish me luck! See you soon!)\n\nThank you! I love you all!\n\n~Gabe",

DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!\n\nTBH, I've been in a pretty frustrating situation lately... 8 of my top ten videos have been flagged for copyrighted content... (Including the new one with 18,000,000 views that I just uploaded last Friday.) This has been a MAJOR blow to my revenue and on top of that, I'm not even sure it's legal! Our Genre Switching videos and my impressions don't use any pre-recorded content and are only a few seconds long, so they should DEFINITELY fall under fair use as they both transformative AND parody, right?... But clearly, that doesn't matter to the people who flagged my videos because there's money to be had... I've tried disputing all the claims and they have all been denied with no reason given.\n\nI've been pretty upset about it because this is a huge chunk of my livelihood and I put countless hours into making these videos, so to have them completely demonetized means that if I don't get this resolved or figure something out soon, I'm gonna have to stop doing this and get another job so I can pay my rent.\n\nAnyway, if any of you have any ideas or connections who might be able to shed some light on a permanent solution, any suggestions would be very much appreciated! I love what I do and would REALLY love to continue doing it!\n\nOn the positive side, my new video has brought a lot of new people to my channel, so if you're one of them, WELCOME!! I hope you enjoy! Here's an easter egg! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmZdJIx6cmU (It's a clip from a very fun low-level flight. similar to my last easter egg, but uncut... I wanted to have something else for you guys, but alas, I must fight the demonetization demons... Wish me luck! See you soon!)\n\nThank you! I love you all!\n\n~Gabe"

I got to participate in a STEAM event at a school down in Rio Rico! I sang the National Anthem, flew my paramotor around for the students, and showed them an old Tesla Coil I built (along with answering questions about YouTube and stuff.) I was actually surprised how many of them knew who I was! It felt like a mini-convention (except I got to fly and shoot lightning bolts! XP) I don't have a video of that yet, but I DO have a video of a particularly awesome sunset flight I had a few weeks ago! Totally Nil wind day, so I could fly incredibly low without having to worry about rotor! Here's a clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQnc3lDfKxk\n\nAnyway, I'm flying to Mississippi this coming Tuesday (March 5th) so keep an eye out for new music, and possible another Genre Switching Challenge! ;-)\n\nI'm gonna go to sleep now...

I've been working on another \"One Guy, 24 Voices\" style video and was hoping to have it done by now, but that whole rabid bat thing got in the way...\nFor those of you who don't know what happened, here's the full story:\n\nI was doing a show in Green Valley, AZ and I found a bat on the ground just before curtain. They're typically hibernating this time of year so, thinking it might be sick, I covered it with a napkin then did my show. When I was done, the bat was still there, so I took him home in a cup and did a mini-exam with a blunt bamboo skewer. He didn't seem to be injured at first, but upon closer inspection, I noticed that the index finger of his left-wing was broken. He was a Western Pipistrelle bat and while they hibernate during the winter, they often forage for food during the day so I figured he must have hit a window at the theater. He was behaving otherwise normally, so I gave him some water and let him climb onto my hand so I could get some pictures. Have a look: https://twitter.com/BlackGryph0n/status/1088713522287005696\n\nThe next day, I called Animal Rescue to see if they could help my injured bat. They said they would take him in and see what they could do. Unfortunately, since he had a broken wing, they had to put him down :-( and since I had touched the bat, they decided to test him for Rabies...\n\nHe tested positive...\n\nSOOOOOOOOOO, the last few weeks have been fun! I went to the VA in Tucson where I got my first four out of seven shots. 1ML of Rabies Vaccine in my right arm and 10 FREAKING ML of vicious Immunoglobulin in the rest of my limbs! I almost passed out (like a flippen wimp) but that was nothing compared to how sore and wacked out I was the next day. Turns out, my body doesn't like being injected with dead rabies virus and someone else's plasma. I was pretty loopy for a bit, but eventually, it wore off. Just in time for me to go get another shot!! :-D I had my sixth shot in the series two days ago and I'll get my last one next Wednesday. Then, hopefully, I'll be immune to rabies for a while so I can hold as many rabid bats as I want! ;-P (I kid I kid.) Seriously though, the shots weren't fun... They may also be pretty expensive (upwards of $10,000) so I'm HOPING the VA will cover most of it... I guess I'll find out when the bill comes in. I may need to start a GoFundMe... ^^;\n\nNow, I've been getting a LOT of flack for this. :-P People calling me stupid or asking me if I've \"learned my lesson\" so let me just say right now: I knew the risk when I held the bat. I was willing to take a 1 in 300 chance to help a bat in need and get a cute picture. I drew the short straw this time, but whenever you gamble you run the risk of losing. Most of the things I do for fun involve a bit of risk. I do what I can to mitigate that risk, but you can never guarantee you won't get hurt while doing something that is inherently dangerous. People have been telling me my entire life not to do things because they are \"dangerous\", or calling me stupid for enjoying things that seem unsafe. It's true, I do tend to enjoy \"extreme\" sports more than the average individual, but I'm not reckless. I always weigh the benefits against the potential negative outcome and if I feel the reward outweighs the risk, I'll do it. We're all going to die eventually. I could die any day. Is living in fear of the unknown and missing out on incredible experiences worth potentially buying me a few extra years? I don't think it is. That's my decision. You can think I'm crazy, but I'm enjoying my life and if I die one day from getting bitten by a snake or jumping out of an airplane, I won't regret the path I took to get there. :-)\n\nOk, rant over. I'm gonna sleep now before I die of exhaustion! XP\n\nGoodnight everybatty!\n\n~Gabe\n\n#Oliver #Disney",

I've been working on another \"One Guy, 24 Voices\" style video and was hoping to have it done by now, but that whole rabid bat thing got in the way...\nFor those of you who don't know what happened, here's the full story:\n\nI was doing a show in Green Valley, AZ and I found a bat on the ground just before curtain. They're typically hibernating this time of year so, thinking it might be sick, I covered it with a napkin then did my show. When I was done, the bat was still there, so I took him home in a cup and did a mini-exam with a blunt bamboo skewer. He didn't seem to be injured at first, but upon closer inspection, I noticed that the index finger of his left-wing was broken. He was a Western Pipistrelle bat and while they hibernate during the winter, they often forage for food during the day so I figured he must have hit a window at the theater. He was behaving otherwise normally, so I gave him some water and let him climb onto my hand so I could get some pictures. Have a look: https://twitter.com/BlackGryph0n/status/1088713522287005696\n\nThe next day, I called Animal Rescue to see if they could help my injured bat. They said they would take him in and see what they could do. Unfortunately, since he had a broken wing, they had to put him down :-( and since I had touched the bat, they decided to test him for Rabies...\n\nHe tested positive...\n\nSOOOOOOOOOO, the last few weeks have been fun!

Just in time for me to go get another shot!! :-D I had my sixth shot in the series two days ago and I'll get my last one next Wednesday.

I named him \"Pip\" because he is a Western Pipistrelle and he's the TINIEST WITTLE BAT I'VE EVER SEEEEEN! (which makes sense because Western Pipistrelle are the smallest bat species in North America). I was doing a show in Green Valley and found him just before curtain. They're typically hibernating this time of year, but this poor little guy was shivering on the ground behind the theater. Not sure how he got there. He must have fallen from his perch or maybe he hit the window during a daytime foraging run? I covered him with a napkin then did my show. When we were done, he was still there, so I took him home in a cup and did a mini-exam with a blunt bamboo skewer. He didn't seem to be injured, just cold, so let him warm up inside. When he was feeling a little better, I gave him some water and he became very curious! Grabbing the stick and climbing around on the counter. Eventually, I let him climb onto my hand and got some ADORABLE pictures! Have a look: https://twitter.com/BlackGryph0n/status/1088713522287005696\n\nAnyway, I spent so much time helping the bat that I didn't get to editing my video until about 1:30am, so I'm VERY tired. Hopefully, I don't mess anything up. :-P\n\nOk, I think that's it for now. Sleep well if you're sleeping.\nwhatever, I'm gonna sleep so I don't care if it's right or not I'm too tired to think about it. :-P\n\nLoveeezzzzz\n\n~Gabe\n\n\n\n#GenreSwitching #Maroon5 #Dubstep",

I named him \"Pip\" because he is a Western Pipistrelle and he's the TINIEST WITTLE BAT I'VE EVER SEEEEEN! (which makes sense because Western Pipistrelle are the smallest bat species in North America). I was doing a show in Green Valley and found him just before curtain. They're typically hibernating this time of year, but this poor little guy was shivering on the ground behind the theater. Not sure how he got there. He must have fallen from his perch or maybe he hit the window during a daytime foraging run? I covered him with a napkin then did my show. When we were done, he was still there, so I took him home in a cup and did a mini-exam with a blunt bamboo skewer. He didn't seem to be injured, just cold, so let him warm up inside. When he was feeling a little better, I gave him some water and he became very curious! Grabbing the stick and climbing around on the counter. Eventually, I let him climb onto my hand and got some ADORABLE pictures! Have a look: https://twitter.com/BlackGryph0n/status/1088713522287005696\n\nAnyway, I spent so much time helping the bat that I didn't get to editing my video until about 1:30am, so I'm VERY tired. Hopefully, I don't mess anything up. :-P\n\nOk, I think that's it for now. Sleep well if you're sleeping.\nwhatever, I'm gonna sleep so I don't care if it's right or not I'm too tired to think about it. :-P\n\nLoveeezzzzz\n\n~Gabe\n\n\n\n#GenreSwitching #Maroon5 #Dubstep"

Any suggestions for other things we should try?\n\n\nAnd now... the links and the credits! *unenthusiastic applause*\n\nTracks produced & mastered by Nate (Baasik) SUBSCRIBE TO HIM:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Baasikmusic\n\nOh, and SUBSCRIBE TO ME TOO, PLEASE! https://www.youtube.com/c/BlackGryph0n\n\nYou can also follow me on:\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/BlackGryph0n\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/blackgryph0n/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BlackGryph0n\n\n\nMerch: www.BlackGryph0n.shop\n\n\nBusiness Inquires: GabrielBrownInfo@gmail.com\n\n\n\n\n- -- --- ----( Songs Used )---- --- -- -\n\n\n\"Fake Love\" - BTS (Bangtan Sonyeondan)\n\"Forget You\" - CeLo Green\n\"Radioactive\" - Imagine Dragons (Dan Reynolds) - \n\"Stay With Me\" - Sam Smith\n\"Cake by the Ocean\" - DNCE (Joe Jonas)\n\"Chocolate\" - The 1975 (Matty Healy)\n\"Can't Stop The Feeling\" - Justin Timberlake\n\"Life Is A Highway\" - Rascal Flatts (Gary LeVox)\n\"Trololo (I Am Very Glad, as I'm Finally Returning Back Home)\" - Trololo Guy (Eduard Khil)\n\"Somebody That I Used To Know\" - GOTYE (Wouter De Backer)\n\n\n- -- --- ----( END )---- --- -- -\n\n\n\nHELLO! DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!!\n\nOh man, I'm currently in a pickle! (a small pickle though... Like, a baby dill)\nI'm exporting a draft of this video now but I have two versions... One that includes some extra footage in the beginning (the part where we explain what the challenge is) and one that just cuts right to the chase. I'm torn between two different trains of thought...\n\nTrain 1 - \"Everybody knows how this challenge works, it's pretty obvious what we're doing... It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that we're drawing an artist and a genre from two bowls and mixing them together. The explanation is 23 seconds long and is just dead weight before the music starts.\"\n\nTrain 2 - \"It's not completely obvious why we're giving the songs a Check or an X if we don't say that we're gonna be judging them, nor does it explain our surprise at reading each other's notes. Also, the footage where we explain what's happening is pretty funny! I enjoy watching it and I'd like to think other people will too.\"\n\nTrain 1 departed Stress Station at 2:30 am and is traveling at 84mph. Train 2 left Brainfart Blvd at 3:15am and is traveling at 62mph. The stations are 421 miles apart and the trains are heading towards each other on the same track... What time will it be when they collide?\n\nJust kidding, don't do math. Math sucks.\nWhat I REALLY wanna know is which train will win!\nI guess all of you reading this already know which one won, 1 or 2, ;-P but I don't know yet and it's making me want ice cream... Wait.... I always want ice cream, nvmnd.\n\n\nANYWAY!!! Here's the extra footage I promised you in the White Frame Diaries! It pains me to cut it but most people come here for music, not to see me and Nate goofing off:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG984p6N3xQ&feature=youtu.be\n\n\nOk, well I'd better go... I've got a train to crash!\n\nLoveyouforalways\n\n~Gabe",

I know I've teased it for a while and it's been put off a number of times due to us both being busy, but it's really looking like we may actually do another album! We have some really strong songs that we've written and really only need to record at this point! I wish I could give you a teaser... AND I CAN!\nHere: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ8KwSWykrI&feature=youtu.be\n\nWARNING: This is VERY VERY early in production (as in I took the chorus sample from Nate and wrote lyrics twenty minutes ago, then recorded quiet vocals in Audacity two minutes ago so I wouldn't wake him up. He doesn't know I recorded this so he may be pretty mad when he finds out and make me take it down.. I guess we'll find out. :-P)\n\nAnyway, I brought y'all these pies (no, that's not true, I just had that line from Zootopia stuck in my head and I couldn't think of anything else until I wrote it down). It's currently 3:30am for me and I'm wide awake because this is way earlier than when I usually finish my Friday upload! I'm also Jetlagged so there's that. Hey, what are you doing for Christmas? (or Hanukkah, or Kwanzaa, or whatever you celebrate). Any cool plans? Any traveling? I'd love to know cause I'm nosey! :-D\n\nOk, that's all I can think of right now...\n\nMerry everything!\n\n~Gabe\n\n\n#ChristmasMusic #LetItSnow",

We recorded the piano and lead first, then we did the beat and harmonies, then because two takes weren't enough, we added a few more harmonies and a keyboard solo. :-P\n\n\nAnd now, the links and credits! *It's a Christmas miracle*\n\n\nPLEASE SUBSCRIBE! https://www.youtube.com/c/BlackGryph0n\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/BlackGryph0n\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BlackGryph0n\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/blackgryph0n/\n\nMerch: https://creberbrown.com/collections/gabriel-brown-black-gryph0n\n\n\nBusiness Inquires: GabrielBrownInfo@gmail.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- -- --- ---- Lyrics ---- --- -- -\n\nOh, the weather outside is frightful\nBut the fire is so delightful\nAnd since we've no place to go\nLet it snow, let it snow, let it snow\n\nWell it doesn't show signs of stoppin'\nAnd I brought some corn for poppin'\nThe lights are turned way down low\nLet it snow, let it snow, let it snow\n\nWhen we finally kiss good-night\nHow I'll hate going out in the storm\nBut if you really hold me tight\nAll the way home I'll be warm\n\nWell the fire is slowly dying\nAnd, my dear, we're still good-bye-ing\nBut as long as you love me so\nLet it snow, let it snow, and snow\n\n- -- --- ---- End ---- --- -- -\n\n\n\n\nHELLO DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!\nOk, so I'm here in Mississiisisosisoisyoushouldhavepickedmercy with my brother Nate and we're working on Christmas Presents, another Genre Switching Challenge for next Friday and of course the video I just uploaded, but we actually have something else in mind... I know I've teased it for a while and it's been put off a number of times due to us both being busy, but it's really looking like we may actually do another album! We have some really strong songs that we've written and really only need to record at this point! I wish I could give you a teaser... AND I CAN!\nHere: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ8KwSWykrI&feature=youtu.be\n\nWARNING: This is VERY VERY early in production (as in I took the chorus sample from Nate and wrote lyrics twenty minutes ago, then recorded quiet vocals in Audacity two minutes ago so I wouldn't wake him up. He doesn't know I recorded this so he may be pretty mad when he finds out and make me take it down.. I guess we'll find out. :-P)\n\nAnyway, I brought y'all these pies (no, that's not true, I just had that line from Zootopia stuck in my head and I couldn't think of anything else until I wrote it down). It's currently 3:30am for me and I'm wide awake because this is way earlier than when I usually finish my Friday upload! I'm also Jetlagged so there's that. Hey, what are you doing for Christmas? (or Hanukkah, or Kwanzaa, or whatever you celebrate). Any cool plans? Any traveling? I'd love to know cause I'm nosey! :-D\n\nOk, that's all I can think of right now...\n\nMerry everything!\n\n~Gabe\n\n\n#ChristmasMusic #LetItSnow"

I have to tell you guys about the last two weeks in LA!\nFirst of all, I went to record a Christian album with an AWESOME family from Hawaii! They were very fun and talented and I had a blast doing that. As soon as the music comes out, I'll drop a link in the next DDR!\n\nAfter that, I went to Jeff (ACRaceBest's) house and hung out until the wedding. It was BEAUTIFUL! I'm not a big fan of weddings, but this one was awesome! I totally ship Jeff and Sara! (Appropriate too, since they got married on a ship!)\n\nOH! And the little guy from Pirates of the Caribbean was there, so that was interesting! XP\n\nI also got an invite to eat at Club 33 in Disneyland (THANK'S ETHAN!!) so I brought Jeff and Sara, Stephen and Laura and Sara's sister, Hillary along. It was INCREDIBLE!!\n\nAgain, I'm not one who usually enjoys the \"finer things\" but man... I could get used to that.

I have to tell you guys about the last two weeks in LA!\nFirst of all, I went to record a Christian album with an AWESOME family from Hawaii! They were very fun and talented and I had a blast doing that. As soon as the music comes out, I'll drop a link in the next DDR!\n\nAfter that, I went to Jeff (ACRaceBest's) house and hung out until the wedding. It was BEAUTIFUL! I'm not a big fan of weddings, but this one was awesome! I totally ship Jeff and Sara! (Appropriate too, since they got married on a ship!)\n\nOH! And the little guy from Pirates of the Caribbean was there, so that was interesting! XP\n\nI also got an invite to eat at Club 33 in Disneyland (THANK'S ETHAN!!) so I brought Jeff and Sara, Stephen and Laura and Sara's sister, Hillary along. It was INCREDIBLE!!\n\nAgain, I'm not one who usually enjoys the \"finer things\" but man... I could get used to that. The food was the best I've ever had, the decor was the epitome of class and the plates and silverware were nice enough to steal! (which I didn't, but I wanted too...)\n\nI definitely see what all the hype is about now...\n(Unfortunately, there were no videos allowed so I can't give any link to that.)\n\nI CAN, however, give a link to some chase cam footage of my last flight!

Is this just fantasy?\nCaught in a landslide, no escape from reality\nOpen your eyes, look up to the skies and see\nI'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy\nBecause I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low\nAny way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me\n\nMama, just killed a man\nPut a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead\nMama, life had just begun\nBut now I've gone and thrown it all away\nMama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry\nIf I'm not back again this time tomorrow\nCarry on, carry on as if nothing really matters\n\nToo late, my time has come\nSends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time\nGoodbye, everybody, I've got to go\nGotta leave you all behind and face the truth\nMama, ooh, (Any way the wind blows)\nI don't want to die\nI sometimes wish I'd never been born at all\n\nI see a little silhouetto of a man\nScaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?\nThunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me\n(Galileo.) Galileo. (Galileo.) Galileo. Galileo Figaro magnifico\nI'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me\nHe's just a poor boy from a poor family\nSpare him his life from this monstrosity\nEasy come, easy go, will you let me go?\nBismillah! No, we will not let you go\n(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go\n(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go\n(Let me go) Will not let you go\n(Let me go) Will not let you go\n(Let me go) Ah\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no\n(Oh mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go\nBeelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!\n\nSo you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?\nSo you think you can love me and leave me to die?\nOh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!\nJust gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!\n\nNothing really matters, anyone can see\nNothing really matters\nNothing really matters to me\nAny way the wind blows\n\n\n- -- --- ---- End ---- --- -- -\n\n\n\n\nHELLO DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!\n\nI'm currently in LA working on a very cool project with some very cool people! There are some insanely talented people here! It's a bit intimidating, but also really fun and an exciting challenge. Rest assured I'll give y'all a link once this project comes out. :-)\n\nI'm recording until next Wednesday, then I'm heading to Jeff and Sara (ACRaceBest and Toodle)'s wedding!! SOOO EXCITED!! I hope he vlogs it! XP\n\nLet's see though... Easter egg... It's been hard to come up with them recently since I've been uploading so many videos! :-P\nOOH! How about this old song by me, Nate and Silva Hound (I think I'm allowed to say that now...) It was a secret project that we did at a con once just to see if we could draw a crowd. Everybody wore Vendetta masks and we started playing this song. People seemed to like it, but I don't think anybody figured out it was us. I don't remember though, it's been a while: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOydXaIqEv8\n\nOK, well I gotta go to sleep because I have a lot of work to do tomorrow. Hope you liked the video(s) and I'll see y'all later!!!\n\n~Gabo",

Is this just fantasy?\nCaught in a landslide, no escape from reality\nOpen your eyes, look up to the skies and see\nI'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy\nBecause I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low\nAny way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me\n\nMama, just killed a man\nPut a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead\nMama, life had just begun\nBut now I've gone and thrown it all away\nMama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry\nIf I'm not back again this time tomorrow\nCarry on, carry on as if nothing really matters\n\nToo late, my time has come\nSends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time\nGoodbye, everybody, I've got to go\nGotta leave you all behind and face the truth\nMama, ooh, (Any way the wind blows)\nI don't want to die\nI sometimes wish I'd never been born at all\n\nI see a little silhouetto of a man\nScaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?\nThunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me\n(Galileo.) Galileo. (Galileo.) Galileo. Galileo Figaro magnifico\nI'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me\nHe's just a poor boy from a poor family\nSpare him his life from this monstrosity\nEasy come, easy go, will you let me go?\nBismillah! No, we will not let you go\n(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go\n(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go\n(Let me go) Will not let you go\n(Let me go) Will not let you go\n(Let me go) Ah\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no\n(Oh mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go\nBeelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!\n\nSo you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?\nSo you think you can love me and leave me to die?\nOh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!\nJust gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!\n\nNothing really matters, anyone can see\nNothing really matters\nNothing really matters to me\nAny way the wind blows\n\n\n- -- --- ---- End ---- --- -- -\n\n\n\n\nHELLO DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!\n\nI'm currently in LA working on a very cool project with some very cool people! There are some insanely talented people here! It's a bit intimidating, but also really fun and an exciting challenge. Rest assured I'll give y'all a link once this project comes out. :-)\n\nI'm recording until next Wednesday, then I'm heading to Jeff and Sara (ACRaceBest and Toodle)'s wedding!! SOOO EXCITED!! I hope he vlogs it! XP\n\nLet's see though... Easter egg... It's been hard to come up with them recently since I've been uploading so many videos! :-P\nOOH! How about this old song by me, Nate and Silva Hound (I think I'm allowed to say that now...) It was a secret project that we did at a con once just to see if we could draw a crowd. Everybody wore Vendetta masks and we started playing this song. People seemed to like it, but I don't think anybody figured out it was us. I don't remember though, it's been a while: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOydXaIqEv8\n\nOK, well I gotta go to sleep because I have a lot of work to do tomorrow. Hope you liked the video(s) and I'll see y'all later!!!\n\n~Gabo"

Ok, first off, I'm getting pretty close to 1,000,000 subs and I'm trying to figure out what to do for it! I thought about doing some kind of ribbon cutting in the air (I've already tested it with a roll of toilet paper at 2,000ft and it was pretty epic! Here's a video: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcMvHFw2cnM&feature=youtu.be ) \nI'm open to other ideas though! What do YOU think I should do for my 1M Sub Special?? Lemme know below! I try to read all the comments I get on a new video in the first few days, but just in case, put \"1MSubs\" in your comment so I can find them in a search! :-)\n\nOh yeah, also Cider Fest 2018 was a blast! Great convention, great people, and it's always fun to hang out with the Crebers and my other friends! During a random conversation with Tony Fleecs (comic book writer/artist extraordinaire) I found out that he used to live in Sioux Falls, South Dakota at the same time I did (back in the early 2000's) and he worked for the local news station that interviewed me when I got stuck on the rocks! (I already posted the video, but here it is again: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbcXuewoPEU&list=LLvzWGXYFDiiJ338KIJPhbhQ )\nHe probably wasn't there back when that happened, but he was DEFINITELY there and working when the city tried (and failed) to demolish an old feed tower! I was standing on the ground watching when this happened and apparently he was working on the coverage that this clip came from! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSxgaIZuy3g\nSmall world!\n\nOh, I also fell for the first time while trying to take off! There were a bunch of contributing factors: short runway, uneven terrain, weird rotor, slippery gravel surface, etc. I plowed into the ground head first at about 20 MPH... My helmet saved my head, but I bashed up both my knees and my left hand pretty good. The left knee has a pretty large laceration (3x1in), while the right knee is heavily bruised and feels lightly sprained... It's pretty interesting though because while I've had both of these types of injuries before, I don't think I've ever had them at the same time! It feels very interesting to walk and feel both external, and internal pain with each alternating step! I can't figure out which leg to limp on!

Had to sing with no voice (which was terrible... so why am I giving you a link to it? Ugh... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD04Ugofy9M ).\n\nAnyway, the con was great and I had a blast! But it didn't do my health any favors and since I had a 14-hour flight right after that, I got even sicker. Eventually, this lovely cold settled in my lungs and well, yeah... This is what I sound like after coughing for a week. :-P\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining or feeling sorry for myself! I can still breath and I'm alive, so life is good! Just thought I'd try to explain the situation in a bit more detail in case you were curious as to WHY I would make a video like this. :-P I have a goal to reach a million subscribers before the end of this year and if I'm gonna do that, I NEED to put out consistent content! At first, I was very worried about losing my voice for over a week, but when life gives you lemons, cough into a microphone for an hour and see what you can edit down!

Had to sing with no voice (which was terrible... so why am I giving you a link to it? Ugh... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD04Ugofy9M ).\n\nAnyway, the con was great and I had a blast! But it didn't do my health any favors and since I had a 14-hour flight right after that, I got even sicker. Eventually, this lovely cold settled in my lungs and well, yeah... This is what I sound like after coughing for a week. :-P\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining or feeling sorry for myself! I can still breath and I'm alive, so life is good! Just thought I'd try to explain the situation in a bit more detail in case you were curious as to WHY I would make a video like this. :-P I have a goal to reach a million subscribers before the end of this year and if I'm gonna do that, I NEED to put out consistent content! At first, I was very worried about losing my voice for over a week, but when life gives you lemons, cough into a microphone for an hour and see what you can edit down!

Recorded in Audacity on my AT2020 mic, filmed on my Canon Vixia camera and synched up in Adobe Premiere. No tuning, or video cuts. (I tried something new with this one though, I took the audio in my first take and brought up the volume about 10% during the choruses to thicken the vocals a bit more. It's a cheap way to get a similar effect to the one on Adam's voice. I also recorded some quiet BG harmonies on certian parts. What do you guys think? Do you like it when I do a bit more production, or do you prefer the completely \"raw\" sound of just one vocal take? :-)\n\n\nAnd now, the links and credits! *bada boop, nobody cares!*\n\n\nPLEASE SUBSCRIBE! https://www.youtube.com/c/BlackGryph0n\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/BlackGryph0n\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BlackGryph0n\n\nInstigram: https://www.instagram.com/blackgryph0n/\n\n\nBuisnes Inquires: GabrielBrownInfo@gmail.com\n\n\nBacking Track available here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut7yoF9BACE\n\n\n\n- -- --- ---- Lyrics ---- --- -- -\n\nSpent 24 hours I need more hours with you\nYou spent the weekend getting even, ooh ooh\nWe spent the late nights making things right, between us\nBut now it's all good babe, roll that Backwood babe\nAnd play me close\n\nCause girls like you \nRun 'round with guys like me\nTill sundown\nWhen I come through\nI need a girl like you, yeah yeah\nGirls like you\nLove fun, well yeah me too\nWhat I want when I come through\nI need a girl like you, yeah yeah\nI need a girl like you, yeah yeah\nI need a girl like you\n\nI spent last night on the last flight to you\nTook a whole day up trying to get way up, ooh ooh\nWe spent the daylight trying to make things right between us\nAnd now it's all good baby, roll that Backwood baby\nAnd play me close\n\nChorus\n\nMaybe it's 6:45\nMaybe I'm barely alive\nMaybe you've taken my shit for the last time, yeah\nMaybe I know that I'm drunk\nMaybe I know you're the one\nMaybe I'm thinking it's better if you drive\n\nChorus x2 (Or that Cradi B. cameo... If you prefer)\n\n- -- --- ---- End ---- --- -- -\n\n\n\n\nWELCOME TO THE END OF THE DESCRIPTION, DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!\nSo, I'm flying to Australia tomorrow morning for Alicon! (woo!) I haven't been there in five years, so I'm expecting it to be completely different! (jkjk) But seriously, I'm really looking forward to it, will I see any of you DDR's there? If so, you know the drill! Say you're a \"DDR\" and you get a hug! (unless you'd rather me not, then don't say you're a DDR I guess).\n\nSo I have a question. I wanna do at least two more impression videos before the end of the year. I'm thinking Super Smash Bros and maybe another singer impression video, but IDK... I toyed with the Idea of doing impressions of other YouTubers (and I still plan to do that) but my problem is... uh... I don't watch a lot of YouTube.. ^^; In fact, I don't listen to a lot of music either! I prefer to spend my time outside, so I'm usually a bit behind on Pop-culture stuffs... That's why I need you guyzezszss help! Tell me what the people WANT!! XP\n\nOh, one thing I AM excited to announce though! Nate and I wrote two new songs last month and we are pushing our way towards a new album (finally)! I know it took way too long, but the thing is, we didn't want to force it... (coughgettingstrongercough) We wanted it to happen naturally and be a project of passion, not something we felt obligated to create, so we've only been writing when we've felt inspired too (and when we have time). We're hoping this new album will be as fun and exciting as IMmortal was, and we hope you enjoy it as much as we do!!\n\nOk, but you're here for the easter egg tho, right? So here's something we did when we WEREN'T writing music... It took like, two hundred tries so when we finally got it, instead of playing it cool (like we planned) I kinda just lost it... ^^; Here ya go! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq8Pk9M3df4\n\nOk, I need to pack...

Recorded in Audacity on my AT2020 mic, filmed on my Canon Vixia camera and synched up in Adobe Premiere. No tuning, or video cuts. (I tried something new with this one though, I took the audio in my first take and brought up the volume about 10% during the choruses to thicken the vocals a bit more. It's a cheap way to get a similar effect to the one on Adam's voice. I also recorded some quiet BG harmonies on certian parts. What do you guys think? Do you like it when I do a bit more production, or do you prefer the completely \"raw\" sound of just one vocal take? :-)\n\n\nAnd now, the links and credits! *bada boop, nobody cares!*\n\n\nPLEASE SUBSCRIBE! https://www.youtube.com/c/BlackGryph0n\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/BlackGryph0n\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BlackGryph0n\n\nInstigram: https://www.instagram.com/blackgryph0n/\n\n\nBuisnes Inquires: GabrielBrownInfo@gmail.com\n\n\nBacking Track available here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut7yoF9BACE\n\n\n\n- -- --- ---- Lyrics ---- --- -- -\n\nSpent 24 hours I need more hours with you\nYou spent the weekend getting even, ooh ooh\nWe spent the late nights making things right, between us\nBut now it's all good babe, roll that Backwood babe\nAnd play me close\n\nCause girls like you \nRun 'round with guys like me\nTill sundown\nWhen I come through\nI need a girl like you, yeah yeah\nGirls like you\nLove fun, well yeah me too\nWhat I want when I come through\nI need a girl like you, yeah yeah\nI need a girl like you, yeah yeah\nI need a girl like you\n\nI spent last night on the last flight to you\nTook a whole day up trying to get way up, ooh ooh\nWe spent the daylight trying to make things right between us\nAnd now it's all good baby, roll that Backwood baby\nAnd play me close\n\nChorus\n\nMaybe it's 6:45\nMaybe I'm barely alive\nMaybe you've taken my shit for the last time, yeah\nMaybe I know that I'm drunk\nMaybe I know you're the one\nMaybe I'm thinking it's better if you drive\n\nChorus x2 (Or that Cradi B. cameo... If you prefer)\n\n- -- --- ---- End ---- --- -- -\n\n\n\n\nWELCOME TO THE END OF THE DESCRIPTION, DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!\nSo, I'm flying to Australia tomorrow morning for Alicon! (woo!) I haven't been there in five years, so I'm expecting it to be completely different! (jkjk) But seriously, I'm really looking forward to it, will I see any of you DDR's there? If so, you know the drill! Say you're a \"DDR\" and you get a hug! (unless you'd rather me not, then don't say you're a DDR I guess).\n\nSo I have a question. I wanna do at least two more impression videos before the end of the year. I'm thinking Super Smash Bros and maybe another singer impression video, but IDK... I toyed with the Idea of doing impressions of other YouTubers (and I still plan to do that) but my problem is... uh... I don't watch a lot of YouTube.. ^^; In fact, I don't listen to a lot of music either! I prefer to spend my time outside, so I'm usually a bit behind on Pop-culture stuffs... That's why I need you guyzezszss help! Tell me what the people WANT!! XP\n\nOh, one thing I AM excited to announce though! Nate and I wrote two new songs last month and we are pushing our way towards a new album (finally)! I know it took way too long, but the thing is, we didn't want to force it... (coughgettingstrongercough) We wanted it to happen naturally and be a project of passion, not something we felt obligated to create, so we've only been writing when we've felt inspired too (and when we have time). We're hoping this new album will be as fun and exciting as IMmortal was, and we hope you enjoy it as much as we do!!\n\nOk, but you're here for the easter egg tho, right? So here's something we did when we WEREN'T writing music... It took like, two hundred tries so when we finally got it, instead of playing it cool (like we planned) I kinda just lost it... ^^; Here ya go! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq8Pk9M3df4\n\nOk, I need to pack... And wash some clothes.. And take a shower.\n\nSEE Y'ALL NEX TIIIIIME!!\n\n~Goob"

OwO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNK8rrGNPXQ\n\nOk, you know what? I really should go to sleep, but before I do, which song mix up thingy was your favorite? How about least favorite? Did you agree with the Checks and X's Nate and I assigned? How many songs had you heard of before? (Ok, sorry. This isn't a survey. :-P) You don't have to answer all of these questions but it's nice to know what my DEDICATED viewers think of my content. It helps me make more of the stuff y'all wanna watch! :-)\n\nK NIGHTYNIGHTHGTHttt\n\n~Me"

Don't know why I keep putting the brackets, I'm pretty sure you already know that down here, DDR doesn't stand for Dance Dance Revolution.\n\nSo I FINALLY have a few weeks off, which means I have a few weeks to make content! Thought I'd drop a cover for y'all while I'm working on my LOTR impression video (hopefully releasing next Friday). After that, I'm going to Mississippippi to visit my brother Nate (Baasik) for a few weeks, and also work on some new music and probably another Genre Switching Challenge! :-P\n\nAfter that, it's off to Australia fro Alicon!! WOO!! I'm super excited! I haven't been to the land down under for like, five years, so I'm super stoked to go back! Any chance any of y'all will be there?\n\nOH, since we're on the Christian topic, here's a video I shot and edited while I was in South Dakota. Celebrate church sent their youth students to camp in Missouri and I went along with them to film with the Phantom (drone). We played this video Sunday for the congregation, but we played the music live. I'm pretty happy with it! :-)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8M0_sDMMgs\n\nK so like it's 4:00am now and I have a headache so I'm gonna take some ibuprofen and go to sleep. \n\nBYEBIEBOOBOOO!\n\n~Gabe",

Don't know why I keep putting the brackets, I'm pretty sure you already know that down here, DDR doesn't stand for Dance Dance Revolution.\n\nSo I FINALLY have a few weeks off, which means I have a few weeks to make content! Thought I'd drop a cover for y'all while I'm working on my LOTR impression video (hopefully releasing next Friday). After that, I'm going to Mississippippi to visit my brother Nate (Baasik) for a few weeks, and also work on some new music and probably another Genre Switching Challenge! :-P\n\nAfter that, it's off to Australia fro Alicon!! WOO!! I'm super excited! I haven't been to the land down under for like, five years, so I'm super stoked to go back! Any chance any of y'all will be there?\n\nOH, since we're on the Christian topic, here's a video I shot and edited while I was in South Dakota. Celebrate church sent their youth students to camp in Missouri and I went along with them to film with the Phantom (drone). We played this video Sunday for the congregation, but we played the music live. I'm pretty happy with it! :-)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8M0_sDMMgs\n\nK so like it's 4:00am now and I have a headache so I'm gonna take some ibuprofen and go to sleep. \n\nBYEBIEBOOBOOO!\n\n~Gabe"

Please lemme know what you think.\n\nOH! Here's a fun easteregg. I couldn't decide between take 2 or 3 for this video since they both had good and bad parts (as usual) so I decided to upload 3 with the music and mic feed, and post 2 unlisted with nothing but camera audio!

Not the case in Hawaii!\n\nA bit of backstory, the reason I went is because my brother, Nate (Baasik) was sent there by the Navy to be a part of something called RIMPAC.

Now, you're not supposed to touch them, but this one turtle near Sharks Cove on the North Shore was so curious and friendly that it was difficult to avoid touching him as he almost swam directly into us several times!

DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!! Well, I'm up super late again! I'm always like two hours behind schedule with these things, but I'm never upset cause I'm usually just relieved that it's done. :-P\n\nIn case you were wondering, our families Lake Powell trip was AMAZING!! Way cooler than I expected and I was expecting a lot! The houseboat was wonderful, the scenery was amazing, and the water was (almost) perfect! (a bit on the cold side).\n\nNate and I jumped from as many cliffs as we could find. Gradually getting higher and higher until it started hurting... Then we dialed it back a bit. ^^; Here's one of the higher ones we jumped from: https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/35081027_10211609765667293_1730236513020542976_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0&_nc_eui2=AeEnTND3ntxMYEn_KZvphGv8Ce-roYaUo_0nlbQ4yG0ugMDI_EKcFCs6LCNi883zMquzx8BhvbRYCRW6DxfnazwdpMVgOs2IaucE8zQMgZbq-A&oh=c92bcf7588752645447f799f601b4faf&oe=5BACB743\n\nOH! We also rented a Jetski and bought a tube. For those of you who don't know, Nate drives Jetski's as part of his job in the Navy, so he was very good at making it almost impossible to hold on. XP\nHere's a video of him (successfully) throwing me off the tube on the last day of our trip: https://youtu.be/sqfewvRFfEg\n\nI'll post some more pictures later, but I'm heading to Hawaii in a few days, then to South Dakota right after that (talk about transplant shock!) then finally to Baltimore for BronyCon! WOO!\n\nHow was your summer so far? Do anything fun? Anything planned for the 4th of July? (or any non-American summer holiday. :-P)\n\nTalk soon!\n\n~Gabe",

DDRs (Dedicated Description Readers)!! Well, I'm up super late again! I'm always like two hours behind schedule with these things, but I'm never upset cause I'm usually just relieved that it's done. :-P\n\nIn case you were wondering, our families Lake Powell trip was AMAZING!! Way cooler than I expected and I was expecting a lot! The houseboat was wonderful, the scenery was amazing, and the water was (almost) perfect! (a bit on the cold side).\n\nNate and I jumped from as many cliffs as we could find. Gradually getting higher and higher until it started hurting... Then we dialed it back a bit. ^^; Here's one of the higher ones we jumped from: https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/35081027_10211609765667293_1730236513020542976_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0&_nc_eui2=AeEnTND3ntxMYEn_KZvphGv8Ce-roYaUo_0nlbQ4yG0ugMDI_EKcFCs6LCNi883zMquzx8BhvbRYCRW6DxfnazwdpMVgOs2IaucE8zQMgZbq-A&oh=c92bcf7588752645447f799f601b4faf&oe=5BACB743\n\nOH! We also rented a Jetski and bought a tube. For those of you who don't know, Nate drives Jetski's as part of his job in the Navy, so he was very good at making it almost impossible to hold on. XP\nHere's a video of him (successfully) throwing me off the tube on the last day of our trip: https://youtu.be/sqfewvRFfEg\n\nI'll post some more pictures later, but I'm heading to Hawaii in a few days, then to South Dakota right after that (talk about transplant shock!) then finally to Baltimore for BronyCon! WOO!\n\nHow was your summer so far? Do anything fun? Anything planned for the 4th of July? (or any non-American summer holiday. :-P)\n\nTalk soon!\n\n~Gabe"

There's something in the air.\nlife's not perfect, but right now I don't care \nI'm feeling pretty good today I just want to let you know.\nA bit of magic in the air and it's everywhere I go.\n\nI've been grinning ear to ear as if someone broke my dial.\nI guess I really like the way my face feels when I smile.\nNo, I can't really tell you why I suppose you called my bluff\nIt's just the way that I feel today and I just can't get enough.\n\nSo move your feet, step to the beat,\nAnd let the rhythm of the music take you down the street\nGet on your feet, feel the beat,\nAnd share the magic of the moment everybody needs.\n(X2)\n\nJump up and dance!\nIf you feel it, let me see it.\nAnd clap your hands!\nAs the beat is repeated.\n(X2)\n\nCan you feel it? There's something in the air!\nIt gives me courage to move like no ones there \nI'm feeling pretty good today, I just want to let you know.\nA bit of music in my step and I've got to let it show.\n\nI can't tell if this feeling is a decision that I've made\nI told a joke in the mirror and baby it was worth the price I paied :-P\nSo get up! Stomp your feet and give the rhythm all you got!\nI can't say it'll make your day but I'll bet it's worth a shot!\n\nSo move your feet, step to the beat,\nAnd let the rhythm of the music take you down the street\nGet on your feet, feel the beat,\nAnd share the magic of the moment everybody needs.\n(X2)\n\nJump up and dance!\nIf you feel it, let me see it.\nAnd clap your hands!\nAs the beat is repeated, repeated, repeated, repeated....\n\n\n- -- --- ---- End ---- --- -- -\n\n\n\n\nHEWWO DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!\n\nOh mah gooness, I am so tired! XD Gotta get up early too so I'm trying to be a responsible little gryphon and go to sleep, but it's not working because my eylids hate me...\n\nSo something crazy happened today! I went flying early in the morning (because the afternoons have been way too windy) and after buzzing around for about half an hour, I noticed a cop car stopped in the middle of a back road near where I was flying...\n(here's a pic: https://imgur.com/QLvKVbm )\n\nIt honestly would have been pretty easy to avoid him if I stayed low and landed in an isolated field for a while, but I decided it would be better to land nearby and see what he wanted.\nI touched down in the dirt off the side of the road and after about a minute, three squad cars showed up!\nThey got out and the lead guy was all \"Hands where I can see them! Take off your jacket! Lift up your shirt! Turn around! Do you have a weapon?\"\nThis annoyed me because I always fly well within the law and FAA regulation, but it's not the first time some ultra-sensitive superstitious citizen has called the cops on me... After a brief interrogation however, I was informed that this time it was actually the boarder patroll that called! Apparently there's a known drug dropping spot around where I was flying and they thought I was flying stuff over the boarder!\n\nOnce they saw taht I was a US Citizen and a veteran they were a lot less concerned and one of them was really curious about my machine! He said \"Have fun, man! I don't know that I could ever do that.\"\nI wanted to say, \"It's fun while you're up there, but sometimes the cops show up when you land\". :-P\n\nI don't have time to post any video easter eggs right now, but hopefully that story will tide you over... Keep an eye on my Twitter and Instagram as I'll probably be posting pictures during our trip!\n\nCherrio! Cheerio daaaaaarling!\n\n\n~Gabe",
