Dear FTC members, 
I am a (content creator/viewer/parent). I would urge you to rethink the current rules and how vague they are. Just because a percentage of the children watching a genre are children doesn't mean you have an obligation to remove all forms of personalization. Watching this content, I would prefer targeted ads that show my actual interests rather than random car or horror film ads. Leave the parenting to parents who make the decision to give their child access to YouTube. If this decision goes through, family-friendly content on YouTube will suffer and families will suffer for it. Content creators do their best to create great content and threatening legal action against individuals over the opinion of ""child appealing"" is excessive.  Please don't ruin one of the most important websites on the internet to me.
