P.S. I had to cut the voice in between each one because I would cough after them or need to drink some water, because I have this stupid cough that won't go away -_-

P.S.S. My hair gets all puffy like that when it's windy outside....so yes, I noticed

P.S.S.S.  I don't own any of the images that were in the video (i'm supposed to say that so they don't sue me)

This one girl who worked there said it's just how the sister plays with her younger sibling. So if you have a younger sibling, these are some games they might enjoy.

BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT if you have seen my other impression videos and are watching this one because you liked them or you hated them and watching stuff you hate is fun for you for some reason, then SORRY it took so long to make another video, I will try to make videos a little faster than once every 3 months.....and not just impression videos either, I wanted to try other videos too


Most of these impressions were requested by someone somewhere though, so maybe they aren't all that random, I don't know what a normal persons view of random characters/cartoons is, since I'm kind of like borderline obsessed with cartoons and voice acting....DO I need therapy? Probably not? IDK, maybe talking to a camera in your room, after kicking your family out of the house for a while is a normal thing? I guess it's better than someone in their 20's talking to imaginary friends, right? Hahaha (btw, if any of my imaginary friends are reading this, I wasn't being serious)

If you have any other impression requests, just leave them in the comments I need help making a new list!!
Or an idea for an impression video, like Nintendo/Harry Potter/Adventure Time/Nickelodeon/Cartoon Network and like that persons comment, so I can see if there is one that has like 4 likes and then maybe do it

P.S. This was filmed on two different days because my camera died, so that's what's up with the different looking days

P.S.S. It takes a CRAZY amount of time to edit these videos with all the picture and words, so if I messed up...again...and accidently skipped a number or anything, sorry...It's also hard to count after 10, when you don't have any fingers left over, you know what I mean? Right? Right? Yeah...totes

P.S.S.S.S.S.  A.D.D. thought...why do Unicorns have that horn? I mean, what does it really do? Is it why they can fly? Or is it just for magic powers and stuff. And what happens if it falls off? Do they turn into a horse? Or a donkey? Or do they stop being able to fly/use magic powers? There should be a job for people who study this stuff, it's important

Originally this video had 134 impressions, but it was over 10 minutes, so I did an insane amount of cutting to get it under 7, haha. Apparently when you do over 100 impressions that each go on for like 15 to 30 seconds, it turns into a really long video...But anywho, I tried to keep the most popular cartoons and characters from Cartoon Network in the video, sooooo hopefully I didn't miss any popular ones!!

Also, if you noticed how the background and my clothes and my beanie randomly changed a couple times, that is because I basically filmed this whole thing twice, but lost most of the footage from the original one because technology dies when I touch it. I had to use a couple clips from the older footage though, because I forgot to do those impressions in the newer footage. DON'T YOU LOVE WHEN TECHNOLOGY DIES AT THE WORST TIMES?!?!? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! (SARCASM) hehe

One time I had to write this 50 page story for one of my college classes and literally seconds after I finished accidently spilled water all over my laptop, because you know, I guess my body felt like it, and then my laptop died. (Oh and my story too)
Fun times, fun times...

Cartoon Network helped inspire me to like cartoons, true story. 

Just like sugar inspired me to want more sugar or how touching a burning stove inspires 69% of kids to not want to touch stoves anymore or how seeing a Michael Bay movie inspires someone to not want to see anymore Michael Bay movies or how repeatedly falling down the stairs inspires my brain to not want to keep falling down the stairs, which ends up being pointless because my body seems to still like falling down the stairs, kind of like how my brain would have said that pouring water all over my laptop would probably not be a good idea, but my body decided it would try it anyways. The lesson of the story is, your body is evil and wants to destroy you. 

P.S. It's totally normal for someone in their 20's to say Cartoon Network is their favorite channel, right??

P.S.S. If it's not normal, that is like age discrimination or something...ageism?? Is that a thing??

P.S.S.S. If you're a 90's kid who still loves Cartoon Network, shout out in the comments!! WHOO!!! Mostly because I feel lonely...

P.S.S.S.S. Totally kidding about that whole lonely thing. I have such a huge group of friends, I can't even begin to name all of them. Or even one of them. The non-fictional ones at least. I can name like 20 fictional ones off the top of my head easily. Ice King, Marceline, Scooby-Doo, SpongeBob, Patrick, Eduardo, Wilt, Bubbles, Raven, Starfire, Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Mickey Mouse, Goofy...see I totally have friends...

P.S.S.S.S.S. I just prefer the cartoon ones over the fleshy ones because the fleshy ones always make up excuses like ""I can't hang out, I'm at work,"" or ""I can't hang out because I'm on vacation with my family in Australia,"" or ""I was just viciously mauled by a grizzly bear and am in critical condition at the hospital,"" or ""The phone number you are trying to reach has been disconnected..."" 
P.S.S.S.S.S.S. Speaking of Adventure Time, did you know they are making a movie?!?!?!? Like an actual, movie theatre movie!!?!?!? Not one of those made for T.V. movies, but a legit movie movie?!?!?!? They didn't say when it comes out yet?!?!?! But I'm wicked excited!?!?!?! The usage of question marks and explanation points in this paragraph is getting out of hand !?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?

The following video is based on a true story. The stuff that happened in it, happened in real life. It's about some guy trying to sound like 100 singers/peoples. It's probably going to be suckish since he literally only sings when he's alone in his car or shower...so he apologizes for any wrong lyrics, pitchy-ness, or bad singing-ness in the video.

B T Dubs, this video had like a million different things to put together and I had to keep cutting and cutting to get it as short as possible because at first it was like 18 minutes long!!!!
So there are a lot of parts that sound really weird or cut short. That's why, hehehe

I also should probably take better care of those wigs. They look even frizzier than my hair, which is really frizzy right now since it's summer. I should probably get it cut. Maybe a mullet? I think those are popular, right? Maybe I can just ask Miley Cyrus, she has really good, clean, family-friendly, taste in how to dress and stuff.

Is anyone reading this anymore? I guess if you read that you are, did you read the disclaimer thingy? Hehe, did you get it, did you get it? At stands for Adventure Time!!! I'm so sneaky
But it's totally normal for a guy over 20 to have a cartoon crush, right?...and watch cartoons....and make videos on YouTube trying to sound like them??...hmm, yeah, I think I need a girlfriend O__o
Maybe Marceline or the real, non-cardboard cutout Jennifer Lawrence is single...and desperate!!!! EEEEEK 

Oh yeah, for anyone who watches all my videos and is subscribed to me, THANKS!!! And SORRY!!!! You clearly have a problem...hehehe, I'm just kidding. Seriously thanks though, and sorry for taking like...5 months for this video?? I was doing stuff, stuff like for the cia or men in black and I was busy...and lazy, but I'll try to stop being so lazy and make more videos

P.S. this video originally had 120 singing impressions (I really suck at counting apparently) so I cut like 20 of them, but I might try making a shorter one of just band impressions or something if anyone wants me to :P

P.S.S. I used that clip at the beginning of the video from my first 100 voice impressions video and in that first video I was coughing a lot, I was also coughing a lot in this one!!! Whoo!!! Thank you asthma!!! Oh and yeah, I wasn't dying, it's just this kind of asthma that makes me cough and lose my breathe a little when my allergies get bad and I had a sinus infection the week before making this so my voice was still a little shaky and stuff

P.S.S.S.S.S.S. I really want to dress up like Quasimodo now and run around in public singing. I think he's part goat. Seriously, look up a video of him singing, I tried to sound like him but...(Duh, bro it's called an impression video)...I know it's an impression video but that doesn't meant it's a good impression (Well that's obvious) What's that supposed to mean!! (If it was a good impression then it would sound like him and not like a constipated goat) HEY!!!!...good burn bruh!!! (OMG, THANKS!!!! I just though of it myself!!) NO WAY!!!! (LOL) ROFLCALCDTMHA
(Rolling on floor laughing, cramping, and losing consciousness due to having asthma).....

Soooooo the most requested type of impression video I've been asked to make (like 11 times) is...was...are...were...Adventure Time!!...which is one of my favorite shows, so I thought ""OH MAH GLOB, I GOTS TO TRY DEM IMPRESSIONS!!!""
Sooooooooo I did...this is it,well not this, this is the video description thingy, but the video above it that is possibly playing  (Depending on your internet connection and if you didn't pause it because you hated it)
OH, and since I'm such an AT nerd, I actually tried most of these impressions from memory, but I think I remembered what pretty much all of them sounded like...that doesn't mean they are going to be good impressions though, I think my Jake impression sucked for example, but I know WHAT he sounds like

OH YEAH!!! Ok, so the Lady Rainicorn impression...I tried using this translator app to write a sentence in Korean and then I listened to it and tried to say it while trying to sound like Lady Rainicorn, which means I was trying to sound like a girl, who speaks Korean, while trying to also speak Korean, which I don't know.....sooooooo if I said anything offensive by accident in Korean, I'm sorrrryyyyyy!!!! it wasn't my fault!!!!!! it was the translator thingys!!!!!!

But if you DO speak Korean, then write in the comments, what I actually said!!!...if I said anything, hehe

I also didn't try an Ice King impression in this video because I want to actually practice that one, which is saying a lot about how much I like the Ice King since I literally never ""Practice,"" any of the impressions because I'm lazy but not really it's just my attention span, I probably couldn't focus long enou


P.S. For anyone who actually watches my videos, sorry for not making videos that often, I PROMISE I am going to try to make them faster, I just have a crazy schedule, but I'm going to try making them faster now ^w^
okay?

P.S.S. Maybe Okay should be our always...hehehe, get it?? Like from TFIOS??...that movie has a lot of feels in it....  V_____V
No worries though, in my head, after the screen went black, the guy woke up and it turns out he was just in a coma, but now he's cured and so is Shailene Woodley, who btw apparently eats clay, has no house, makes her own food, and carries everything she owns in a rolling suitcase...and also is Divergent, so she's pretty much the Queen of all hippies/hipsters, but in a cool, non-crazy-celebrity type of way...plus she's cute, hehehehehe (giggle giggle)

P.S.S.S. I feel like having a hippie phase now

P.S.S.S.S.S.S. Someone asked me what would I do-OO-oo for a Klondike bar....well I've never had one...so I guess, I would maybe want to try one because the commercials are kind of funny and the song is catchy, so I guess I would pay $0.95 for a Klondike bar

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. How long does it take before you can tell if you have food poisoning??? I just made fish but I can't cook so i'm pretty sure i'm going to get food poisoning, plus I'm a little dizzy, but that might be from it being 4:56 am right now while I'm typing this, my sleep schedule is kind of messed up right now, hahahaha, I don't know why I'm laughing at that, my brain is in loopy lala land right now since it's late, it gets cray up in my bray bray (that's my brain), but luckily my family is going to Hawaii on Friday for a week, so i'm already on Hawaii's time, hehehehe...but yeah, I'll probably sleep in tomorrow until 3 pm....goodnight!!!!"

The first 101 though were the 101 that I could remember what they sounded like the best and I could only remember like half of these, so I'm sorry if they don't sound anything like what they are supposed to at all
I just made up random noises or guessed what those ones sounded like, hehe

P.S. After making this video, I would have tried 202 Pokémon voice impressions and I think that is the most on YouTube...that's pretty cool isn't it? I'm pretty swaggie now...swag? swagadelic? swagalishish? swagsome?.....

P.S.S. Sorry about me trying to act cool and saying swag, I probably just killed that word for you...if you're read that far

P.S.S.S. Now that I think of it, someone who has enough time to try 202 Pokémon voice impressions probably doesn't have much of a social life...hmm..... 

I'm not a nerd though...right? I mean, collecting Pokémon plushes, toys, games, playing the games in college, and spending a few hours making a video where I try over 200 voice impressions of them doesn't make me a nerd....

OK, I'm a Pokenerd...hehehehe

^__^

bt dubs I'm going to start making more videos soon. I just FINALLY finished another list of 100 random voice impressions, soooooo I will try that soon AND I also wanted to make other random videos.....

If anyone reads this far, then I only have one word to say...Konichiwa"

SO, I wanted to try SpongeBob impressions. 62 impressions, precisely, according to my scientific studies...I think...I didn't number them, so it was hard to count...62 give or take a few...dozen....
Speaking of dozen, I bought a dozen donuts this morning and already ate 5. They are probably going to go straight to my thighs...JUST LIKE KRABBY PATTYS!!! I've had a Krabby Patty. A REAL, Genuine, 100%, Krabby Patty. I found the recipe. Unfortunately my cooking skill is equivalent to a brick, so it ended up catching on fire and tasting like a brick...shortly after, food poisoning fatally set in...
BUTT anywhoo, here is this random persons' attempt at SpongeBob impressions. OOOH, but they are completely by memory, so if any are just bloody terribly, it's because it by memory...or because I just did a really bad impression...
USUALLY, when I try impressions, I pull up a video to hear what they sound like, but I couldn't do that with SpongeBob. NO, a TRUE stalkerish-level-obsessed fan of SpongeBob wouldn't need to remember what the voices sounded like, because they would have watched each and every episode at least 1,000 times, ignoring their friends, family, job, and life in general as a way of showing their love for the show!!!
Some may say, ""This guy must have no social life whatsoever, spending this much time watching SpongeBob..."" Haha, well you know what I have to say to that???? Yep
Oh, but only the first few seasons of SpongeBob...and the movies...in my mind, the rest is non-canon....it's PCS...(Post Coma-Squidward)
PCS = A scientific theory of scientific things and such that I came up with to explain the change in the personalities of the characters and show as time went by. Some may say ""OH, well the creator left after the first 3 seasons/first movie, which was supposed to end the series, but then Nickelodeon ordered more episodes, so they got new writers and started making episodes faster, in favor of quantity over quality and as time went by, the show changed into this horrid, disfigured, beast of a show that had no resemblance whatsoever to what it used to be, aside from the setting....""
But what actually happened (At least in my mind), is that somewhere around the 4th or 5th season, Squidward went into a stress coma. 
Stress coma = A coma caused by wumbo amounts of stress. (Discovered by me, PhD, MD)
So the changes to the show are all taking place inside Squidwards mind, none of it is real or canon!!! NONE OF IT I TELL YOU!!! (At least in my mind, hehe)
That's just me though, feel free to like the newer SpongeBob if you want. On the inside, we're all SpongeBob fans, man. We're all groovy in our own narly ways. Our love for SpongeBob is like a vast, swirling, wonderland of sparkling white love...let it fill our senses with cascading, fluffy pillows of excitement and comfort as we've never felt before. It's like the Beatles said, ""All you need is swag...""
...Oh, sorry, I got confused, that's the unknown, modern teen boy band, the B-TLZ...
Seriously though, I don't know where I would be today if it weren't for SpongeBob...rather than being a socially isolated, kid-dult, who works in retail and watches mostly cartoons, I'd probably be some successful, business-owning, mature, grown-upy-person with a large amount of money and respect amongst my peers...hmm...
BUTT you know what!?!? I don't care, because I did what everyone said a kid couldn't do! I made it to Shell City, and I beat the Cyclops, and I rode a horse this one time, and I brought the crown BACK!!!
SO yeah, I'm a kid!! And I'm also a goofball!! And a wing nut!!! And a Knucklehead McSpazatron!! 
But most of all, I'm...I'M...I'MMM...
I""M A GOOFY GOOBER!! ROCK!!
...hopefully, if you're reading this, you watch SpongeBob...otherwise this video description might seem a little...odd...and that would be very misleading of my personality, I'm not odd at all...
P.S. Did you know SpongeBob is actually an adult??? In the episode, ""Sleepy Time,"" SpongeBob gets his drivers' license, which shows his birth year to be 1986, so technically he's actually an adult, who just happens to be a kid at heart, like me!!!! 
P.S.S. This P.S. section is about to get filled with Sponge-nerdness. 
P.S.S.S. Did you know the first SpongeBob movie, released in 2004, takes place at the end of the series, so every single episode and even the newer movie from 2015, all take place before the first movie, which is why the Krusty Krab 2 never appears anywhere else???
P.S.S.S.S. Starfish eat sponges, so Patrick's a pretty cool guy for not carvnivorizing his friend...then again, Patrick isn't the brytest  crann in the lite bullb bocks....
P.S.S.S.S.S.S. SpongeBob's address is 123 Conch Street, Bikini Bottom if you want to ever send him something...And yes, I've tried sending actual mail before....he didn't write back..."

Most of the impressions were either requests I got from people or longer versions of impressions I did before that some people wanted me to make longer impressions of...and the rest were just random ones to make the video longer...I ended up making it too long again...hmm...probably those last two impressions, they lasted like 3 minutes together...so I guess that the length wasn't that bad then, right??...like 40 or 50 something in 5 minutes...wait, that would still be over 10 minutes if there were 100 impressions...blahhhh, this is hard
Seriously though, when I make these videos, when I'm done picking the impressions I like the most, the video is like 20 minutes, so then I cut like half of it out and check the time and it's only down to like 19 minutes, so then I do the same thing again, and somehow it's up to 23 minutes long, so then I finally just delete 98% of the video and it ends up being like 8 minutes...stupid math...
OH...for anyone who is subscribed to my channel or who watches my videos, I'm really sorry about taking so long to upload videos, I have this really bad habit of working on lots of stuff at once and not finishing things when I get close to finishing them...stupid brain...
Anywhoo, sorry about that, I'm will try to force myself to finish new videos from now on and to not just focus on the impression videos!!!!!
The key word is focus...I don't focus well...it's against my religious beliefs, not really, but if I say that, then my boss at my job can't get mad at me when they tell me to focus and I zone out, I'm just like ""Oooh, see, Mrs. Boss lady, I'm not allowed to focus because it's against the rules of my religion and stuff...""
Then the boss lady will feel bad and say ""It's all good Joshua, you can just watch tv while I make Keira do all our work...stupid Keira...took the last cookie....actually she's kind of hot...
Speaking of hot, I don't like the hot, well not the super hot. Anything over 85 outside and I literally die. Literally, I drop dead as soon as I feel the heat. Literally. Happened twice this week. It's because my allergies get bad the hotter it is and then my asthma gets worse when the allergies get worse and then I can't breathe and then I die. Literally...
Speaking of soap, I used soap for that last Joker impression, well it was this face wash stuff, but it kind of sort of looked like the Joker when I put it on, so the ""Makeup,"" on that impression was soap.  
Speaking of ghosts, I watched this video a week ago, then this girl called my phone and left a voice message (I didn't feel like answering and I didn't recognize the number, you know what they say about that Stranger Danger stuff). The message she left just had her saying 7 days, and she left her number too just in case I needed to ask any questions, but I didn't call her back because I think she was trying to sell me something, that's why she said 7 days, that was like the opening to her selling something to me. Maybe some kind of trip like ""Seven days!!!...iiiiss how long you will be enjoying this completely free CRUISE to Salt Lake City, Utah!!!""
I do like Utah though...they have lots of snow and I like snow, so maybe I should call her back...oh wait, never mind, I deleted the message...oh yeah, but anyways, speaking of evil, malevolent, creepy ghost girls, there is this ghost girl climbing out of my tv right now, she's getting water all over the carpet...no worries, I turned the tv off...wait, she turned it back on, here she comes again...turned it off again...wait she turned it back on...ok just unplugged the tv...didn't work, tv is back on, soggy ghost girl still trying to crawl out of the tv...ok, fixed the problem, just threw the tv out the window, shattered into a lot of pieces"

Sorry, that commercial was just on...time for the regular disclaimer in the video description thingy...sorry for any impressions that might not be 100% or 80% or 30% or even 0.01%....Nintendo characters don't really talk a lot, I kind of just realized that after making this video, a lot of them are like Pokémon, they just say their names or make random noises, I feel some of the people who work at Nintendo probably do that too....
HEY!! There should be a national day to celebrate Nintendo where everyone can only say their name all day like a Pokémon, or where they can only make random noises and say short catchphrases like Mario...
Speaking of Mario, have you ever wondered if he's maybe...well...experiencing side effects of eating those mushrooms??
I had a mushroom one time, I didn't like it, I almost died, my life flashed before my eyes, it was kind of disappointing, I was thinking I would see more cool stuff flash before my eyes, but nope, it was pretty much me sitting on my ass playing video games...don't eat mushrooms, they're bad 

P.S....Some of the characters I tried impressions of aren't actually Nintendo characters, BUT some of them started on Nintendo OR have been in Nintendo games...

P.S.S...If you couldn't tell, I kind of sort of like and want my own real life Yoshi, green or purple or black please....

P.S.S.S. WHY haven't scientists invented real life Yoshi's yet!?!?!?!! I mean, if I was a scientist, that would be pretty high on my list of stuff that has to be invented...behind other important stuff, like cures for illnesses/injuries, flying cars, those flying chairs from Wall-E, flying TV's (so they can follow us wherever we go), superpowers...I want a superpower

P.s.S.s.S.s....Who is your favorite Nintendo/video game character??!?!?! 

??????????? That Yoshi acapella thingy at the end of the video, I made more of that, with more Nintendo songs...so I might put that up sometime

Aloha!! THANKS FOR WATCHING!! I haven't made one of these 100 voice impression videos in a while SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I decided to make a new one

I've done some of the voices in this one before BUTT this one is going to be kind of like a reboot of the 100 voices...so I allowed it haha

If any of them sound bad it's probably just because I wasn't able to blackmail the actual actor into saying the lines for me just off screen (Some of them are so hard to blackmail lol)

IF YOU LIKED THIS VIDEO LEAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR MORE IMPRESSIONS IN THE COMMENTS BELOW!!! i'm going to make a 100 voice impressions of only requests sooooooooooooooooooo
if I use yours in that video your name shall be placed-eth on screen when i try your suggestification

12 out of 9 doctors have determined that watching this video multiple times can cause deathishly horrific conspitation, that's what happened to that dude with the big stick , Gandolf, he watched it too many times. 

HOWEVER, watching it multiple times also has a 63% of giving you magical powers, which is how big stick dude got his magical powers, so you should totally watch this video every day, just remember to eat your fiber kids. I'm pretty sure tires are high in fiber

Originally there were 126 impressions, because apparently I can't count. Maybe that's why all my kids in my math class got expelled. 
It's either that or that one time I had them help me collect 59 lions from zoos and release them into the school to celebrate the release of the Lion King remake 
(One of the lions dropped a deuce in the cafeteria while he was 
eating someone so they might have gotten upset about having to clean his lion droppings)

P.S. A lot of these characters were literally my first time hearing them and trying to sound like them, mostly all of the animes characters because I don't watch anime haha
Not because I don't like anime, I DO like anime (Not to brag, but I've seen at least 91 Studio Ghibili movies) 
I just haven't started any series yet because I have like 52928 shows on my ""need to watch list"" and never know which one to start XD so anywho sorry if any of them were off, twas my first time hearing them and I just tried to mimic a liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine from a YouTube video I saw for each of them haha

P.S.S. OH but I'm going to do a 100 anime characters impression video too SO PLEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASE feel free to leave anime suggestions too!! Hahaha it will help a lot for someone
who doesn't know a lot of anime characters outside of Pokemon and the Miyazaki movies

P.S.S.S. HAPPY HALLOWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN (It's October so that means it's Halloween, all of October is Halloween. Also September. My future wife must accept these 
rules or else I just don't see how this is going to work, I think we need to get a divorce babe. Like, I just can't be with someone who doesn't share my intense love of all things

Sooooooo I didn't think about making this until about a week ago...I...am...exhausted...haha. This took a LOOOONG time to make and I kind of had to rush it a little, but I hope those of you who watch my videos can still enjoy it :)

Honestly, if I didn't stop myself from adding more and more, there would probably have been about another 5 or 6 cut scenes and the whole video would have been like 20 minutes long, XD.

OH, also I had another 8 Halloween themed videos I wanted to make this month but couldn't because my job kept making me have to do my JOB!! Also every single one of those other videos would have taken less time than this one by a lot...I really need to do a better job of balancing video making, hahaha. 

Maybe I should just work on one big one (Like this one) and then do smaller non-impression videos on the side...or I can just lock my brother up in the basement and force him to edit all my videos for me. I know what you're thinking, no worries, I'll make sure to feed him AT LEAST twice a month...also I will probably have to built a basement because there isn't one. 

HEY!!! Since we're talking about basements, you know what basements are GREAT for storing?? I'll give you a clue, you usually force it into garbage bags and after a while it smells bad. Do you give up? The answer is easy!!! 

HUMAN garbage. You know, just regular garbage that humans throw away? If you keep it in the basement it won't smell so bad. It's also a good place to get attacked by evil girls with long black hair. 

Speaking of the Ring, did you know they are making a new one? It's been like 58 years, hasn't it?? By now, the girl (Samara), probably just upgrade to YouTube. I mean, I don't have a SINGLE friend who still uses VHS tapes...because my friends don't exist...anymore..MUWAHAHAHAAHA!!!! Because they all moved away. Except for 2. But I haven't seen them since I was just a little whippersnapper, back in 1492.

P.S. OOOH, if you're a fan of Hocus Pocus, check out my sisters channel!!! She will be uploading a cover music video thingy for the song ""Come Little Children!!!""

P.S.S. WHAT ARE YOU BEING FOR HALLOWEEN!?!??! (If you are being anything for Halloween) I'm going as Samara from the Ring. My costume will be amazing. I spent a lot of time on it. Probably about 12 minutes. When I bought it, that is. I bought a wig and then the clothes. I'm a very dedicated cosplayer.

P.S.S.S. IT is 5:22 AM as I am typing this right now, and I...am...tired....right....now...

P.S.S.S.S. OOH!!! Did you see my YouTube plaque thingy in the background?!?! It's the first one, the one you get for 100,000 subscribers!! I've had it for a while now, but I thought it would be cool to put in the background above my Snowboard...which I never get to use...BECAUSE IT NEVER SNOWS HERE!!!!

P.S.S.S.S.S.S I want to build a snowman, HMU Anna...also, WE SHALL BE MARRIED in the morning!! (Haha, it's an enchanted reference, do you get it? They're making a second one of those too)

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S You know what movie needs a sequel? Twilight. There clearly weren't enough of them. There is just so much left to tell about Bella's story and far too many emotions that she can't contain and needs to let out. #WeWantMoreTwilightMovies

HELLOOOO

Sorry this video took like an extra week, but I seem to have a problem with not adding more and more stuff to videos as I'm editing it, haha. Anywhooo, this was supposed to be just Shrek impressions, then it was supposed to be 100 DreamWorks impressions, but then I realized that the video was over 10 minutes, so then I changed to 52 DreamWorks impressions...I think...I only counted once...and got distracted multiple times in the process...

SPEAKING of distractions, I think my brain might be addicted to distractions. It's constantly looking for more and more. It won't stop using them. I'm concerned. I think I need to have one of those intervention things. My brain needs to admit it has a problem. That's the first step, brain. Admit that you have an addiction and stop getting so easily distra


I thought I saw a Unicorn last week. I mean, obviously I didn't really see one, haha. It's Unicorn hibernation season. Speaking of hibernation, I have decided to officially start my own hibernation season. I have come to the conclusion that I...do not...like hot weather. Nope. I do not like it. If I'm President someday, I plan on making hot weather illegal.  Also, I will then make politics illegal, because they bore me and I don't like wearing suits. Plus, I'm not good at yelling and making fun of people, and I that seems like 99% of Politics. The other 1% is ignoring real issues in the world, like Unicorn endangerment. I remember, back when I was a kid in the 40's, I would go outside and see like 58 Unicorns rolling around, wrestling in the grass. That was a different Unicorn season though. 

Speaking of back in the old days, remember back in the old days when you had to talk into your phone instead of just texting?? Apparently  our cell phones can too!!!! Crazy, right?!?!! 
My phone starting making this weird noise last night, like a text alert, but longer, it was like a ringing. 
So I picked it up and pushed a green button, then I heard a voice. At first I thought it was a paranormal activity, because I like to jump to super logical explanations right away, BUT then I tried talking back to the voice and realized it was my MOM!!! 
Then I jumped to the next most logical conclusion, that my Mom had angered one of our neighbors, who must have apparently been some kind of witch or warlock, who then used their powers to trap my Mom inside my phone until the dice read 5 or 8. 
But then she explained to me how our phones can be used to actually talk to other people and how it's not only much quicker to talk than text, but also more personal and special than just taking turns texting. 
So then I threw my phone out the window.  It's in phone heaven now.
R.I.P. Phoney 28 (That's was my phones name...He was named after my first 27 phones...my phones die a lot...)

BUT anyways, like I was saying, I just ended up using like 50 something DreamWorks impressions since there are probably enough characters in some of the movies to make just impression videos of those movies, so if you like watching my impression videos and want to see me try a DreamWorks impression video about just one of their movies,  just say so in the comments!!
 
P.S. Did you like totally realistic my Jack Frost cosplay?? I haven't actually seen that movie before, so if that one was insanely off..it's probably because I've never seen that movie, hehe.

P.S.S. If you've seen my other videos, could you also tell that wig was new? Not because I haven't used it before. But because it didn't look like it had been stuck the tire of a car for like 5 months. Yeah, my sister told me, supposedly, that if you keep the wigs folded nicely in plastic bags that they won't get all tangley  and frizzy and stuff. I don't know much about hair science since I'm not a hair doctor, so I just agreed. 

P.S.S.S. Is anyone else going to Disney World around Christmas time?? My family is!!! WHOOO!!! I've been saving up my moneys from my jobs, so I can come with and buy like 228 things!!!...and then I won't have money anymore!!! WHOOO!!!!

P.S.S.S.S. I just mentioned Disney in a video about DreamWorks, I'm pretty sure it's against the law to mention those two together, so if I don't upload a new video in the next 52 months, it's most likely because they sent like ninjas after me and I was fatalized. (Past tense, verb-form of fatal)

P.S.S.S.S.S. Has anyone ever made one of those Pixar universe/timeline things for DreamWorks? Donkey's wife pretty much confirms that they all take place in the same Universe...OR what if DreamWorks and Pixar are the same UNIVERSE!?"

I think that's like 400 total voice impressions unless you count the Pokémon ones, then it's like 580 or 590 something. I will just guess 589 because I like that number
Yay for my lack of a social life!!!....(sigh)
Just kidding, I have fun making these...in my room by myself

So sorry if a lot of these don't sound anything like what they are supposed to, I didn't know like 10 of these before making this video and I've never seen a lot of the shows like Ren & Stimpy and Jerry Seinfeld, plus these are like the backups to the backups to the backups...unless you count the Pokémon ones, then they are like the backups to the backups to the back...you get it

Oh yeah, if you notice how it looks like some of the voice impressions were done on different days, that's because I had 20 new singing impressions that I tried, but then I realized I had enough singing impressions from this video and the last one to make a video just for singing impressions, soooo I just did 20 new impressions to replace them....


(And I might put up the singing ones this week...I'm kind of sort of, really, really, shy about singing aaaand a lot of the new ones were not me trying to sound like the singers, but me trying to sing the style they did in my normal singing voice...at least I think it's my normal singing voice...idk, I talk in too many voices every day to tell what my real voice is...AHHHHH!!!!! WHAT DO I SOUND LIKE?!?!?!?!?!

P.S. Thanks for all the nice comments and stuff, I wouldn't keep making these vids without all of the nice comments!!

P.S.S. If you have other ideas for an impression video like cartoon network or Nintendo or nickelodeon or other characters, just leave a comment thingy sooo I can see if there is one impression thingy some peoples like more than others and then I can do that impression thingy...maybe...I mean if it's weird or embarrassing, then I won't...well I guess doing 500 something impressions is kind of embarrassing showing how I have nothing to do on my weekends but sit in my room watching videos on youtube, and making weird noises and talking to a camera....yeah, I totally need a girlfriend, hahaha...why am I hahahaing?

P.S.S.S.S.S.S I skipped a few P.S.'s

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. I just noticed how shiny my skin was in this video...no I'm not a twilight vampire (I still think they are actually fairies..i mean they sparkle, live in trees, and can fly...!!!)
anywhoo, it's because i was in the sun and put on that sunburn lotion stuffs...plus I am a vampire...not a twilight one though...

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. I changed my mind...I want to be a werewolf, I like werewolves more....

SpongeBob sings Ocean Man!!

Ahoy!! Have you ever been walking your dog, cat, and/or younger sibling and wondered what it would be like if all of Bikini Bottom sang that song Ocean Man from the first SpongeBob movie?

Well NOW you have like 60% of your answer!! (The minus 40% is for any voices that were a little suckish)

ANYWHOOS since my sister (That short thing in this video) is going to be doing this internship-ish thing for the next 5 months I wanted to make another video with her before she left and we figured WHAT BETTER VIDEO THAN A SPONGEBOB RELATED VIDEO??!?!?!

Ok, not really. My nicer camera actually stopped working (After I kind of dropped it from 5 feet high onto it's flip screen) sooooooo
I wasn't able to keep working on the video I originally had planned for today so then me and Brandi had to put this one together in like a day and a half haha (Well mostly me, she like barely helped with the editing that I always do, THANKS A LOT BRANDI)

BUTT one of the song requests I had gotten from someone (ANOTHER SHOUTOUT TO SPENCER CARROLL) was to do a SpongeBob themed impression cover and me and Brandi are obsessed with the first SpongeBob movie...well and pretty much everything else SpongeBob haha SO she chose Ocean Man.

BUTT anywhoos there is a good chance that there might be ANOTHER video up next Friday...and then possibly the Friday after that...and then the one after that!!!!! FOR REALZ!! CRAZY I KNOW!!! MOSTLY ONLY CRAZY IF YOU KNOW ME AND HAVE BEEN WATCHING MY CHANNEL WITH MY SLIGHTLY INCONSISTENT UPLOADING CONSISTENCIES OF THE PAST

But that's in the past, I'm a changed man now. I've been laying out my own clothes for nearly FIVE MONTHS now. I don't even need my mom to match my clothes anymore!! And since my house arrest ended due to that ""public indecency"" incident I'm now totally free to go out in public again!! (In my defense, I'm slightly colorblind so I couldn't tell I was only wearing boxers, I thought my shirt and pants just happened to be the same color of my skin)

P.S. Did you know that one of the official ingredients for Krabby Patties is crab? So yeah, Mr. Krabs is kind of slightly cannibalistic
P.S.S. Call your local crab conservation organization and donate to help end crab on crab violence
P.S.S.S. Can you tell SpongeBob is my favorite show of all time??
P.S.S.S.S. I don't really make it too obvious do I?
P.S.S.S.S.S. If you've seen me filming in my room with the background wall completely covered in SpongeBob decorations you probably wouldn't have even guessed then either
P.S.S.S.S.S.S. If you're still reading, what's your favorite SpongeBob episode???
P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. OR if you're still reading, how much money would pay to get to try an ACTUAL Krabby Patty??
P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Happy early Leif Erikson Day...again haha

(Those of you who watch my videos) This one took longer than expected...

And for those of you who haven't seen one of my videos, ""Hey there, what's up? How's it going? Thanks for watching! Even if you only watched for a few seconds and then changed your mind. Or even if you watched the whole thing and want your potentially wasted time refunded. Hiiiiiii...also, due to overwhelming complaints, we are unable to refund lost time at the moment)
But anywho, being the Star Wars nerd that meesa be, I was unable to control my perfectionist-ism and wanted to try something a little different. 

I probably shouldn't do that for every impression video though, considering it took me about a month to work on this one...okeeday!! I gots an idea. I will keep making unnecessarily long and off topic impression videos like this, but I will also start trying to make shorter, but equally off topic impression videos too, so I can work on the big ones and keep uploading shorter impression and non-impression videos too.

Also, if you DO watch my videos, you might have noticed my new $1,000 camera. I got it off this drifter. He was dead, so I figured he wouldn't need it. Plus, he wasn't using it when I accidentally hit him with my car on purpose. 

Kidding, kidding. hitting people with cars is bad. You should not do it. It's been illegal in most places I've moved from. I actually bought the camera fair and square from this nice guy who worked in a dark alley. He had lots of jewelry, plants, and some sugar he kept in bags too. Right after I left, a couple cops came by and escorted him away, so he must be an important person. 
Speaking of the ridiculously hot weather, the weather here has been ridiculously hot...weather...it's about that time of year again that the Joshiiwuh's begin their summer migration, hiding away for a few months to protect their frail, easily-sun burnt, allergetic bodies from the blistering heat and allergens, only venturing out into the wilderness for occasional trips to swim in the local watering hole, where other, less allergy-prone and un-sun-burnable creatures spend all day on their backs, absorbing the suns healthy UV rays...

P.S. Watering hole means swimming pool.

P.S.S. Don't drink from your local watering holes

P.S.S.S. Making this entire video in Roman Numerals was extremely difficult for someone who has trouble not messing up when using normal numbering

P.S.S.S.S. I did it because Star Wars uses Roman Numerals...it...was...horrific...almost like I was back in high school having to...LEARN things!!!

P.S.S.S.S.S.  HEY, you know that company Ramen Noodles? They should make a Roman Numeral shaped meal thingy. They can call it Ramen Noodles' Roman Numerals...try saying that 5 times fast. 

P.S.S.S.S.S.S. If you have any impression requests, leave them in the comments below, I'm already planning out a few of the more popularly requested ones like Gravity Falls, YouTubers, TMNT, MLP, Dreamworks, and a couple others, but I could always use more ideas

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. A lot of these impressions were just normal actor voices which I haven't really practiced...ever, haha, I usually just try cartoons, but real life peoples seems like it would be fun to try too, so I promise those will get better!!

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Finding Dory comes out in less than a week!!!!!!!!!! RIGHTEOUS!!! RIGHTEOUS!!! RIGHTEOUS!!! Just keep swimming, just keep swimming, but make sure to close your mouth because those little kids like to pee where you swim...

(Disney Voice Impressions)

NEW VIDEOS EVERY 10th, 20th, and 30th of every month!!!
Please feel free to make me happy and like, comment, subscribe, and all that other stuff YouTubers always say. I'll also accept one live panda to keep as my child

HEY LOOK!!! It's one of those 100 voice impression things....I feel like I haven't made one of these in 3 or 4 years haha. BUT NOW I SHALL START MAKING THEM AGAIN!! This is my first one, so I might be a little rusty and out of practice, also I was dealing with a cold/annoying cough so I didn't fully have my voice, but I'm also kind of a perfectionist so maybe I'm just being hard on myself hahahAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

ANYWHO these are all me trying to sound like characters from this pretty unknown company called Pixar. Originally I recorded like 150 impressions BUUUUUUUUUT some of them didn't make the cut and then others (THE 5 EMOTIONS FROM INSIDE OUT) were completely lost because my camera somehow just stopped recording while I was filming which is annoying because I had a whole skit I filmed for them!!!! OH WELL, maybe I can just make that into a video by itself

Do you think my toys hate me for leaving them in boxes in the attic? I mean in Toy Story 3 at least Andy was going to put them in a garbage bag, which has got to be MUUUUCH easier for the toys to escape, right? Also I'm pretty sure there are bats living in our attic too. I'm sure toys don't mind a little guano here and there. (Guano means bat poop kids, yay for learning #siense)

I wonder if in like 40 years Pixar will make a Toy Story 52 but instead of with toys it would be about smartphones and tablets and stuff that are alive. You know since kids by then probably won't even play with toys (RIP toys'R'us….taken from us too soon)

But then the smartphones and tablets and stuff will start to realize just how much power they have and they'll connect to the internet and take over the world like in that one movie. 

Do you think toys sleep? I'm pretty sure in Toy Story 2 that Woody was sleeping and had a nightmare, so wouldn't that mean that Woody has emotions like in Inside Out?? And what about the emotions? Do they like have their own emotions too?? Is there a never ending chain of emotions controlling other emotions???

Sometimes I miss playing with my toys, but then I realize it's not my fault I don't anymore because anytime I go up to other adults and ask if they want to play with me they just look at me funny and walk away. I used to play this game with my sister where we'd throw some of our stuffed animals into the fan and see how far it made them fly, like not to be evil, just because it looked funny and made us laugh. We never hatefully threw them, we always lovingly threw their skulls into the rotating blades that chucked their bodies 40 feet across the room. To be honest, I've even done the same thing with my sister Brandi (The one in this video), literally, ask her. I threw her into a fan...twice...also once a brick ceiling....
BUT I was doing it out of love, I was doing that thing where you toss the small child up really high and catch them, but I just happened to not noticed the ceiling and fans that were like 2 feet above her head (Or 20 feet, I can't remember how far I chucked her)

P.S. I'm once again editing a video at 5am in the morning WHOO

P.S.S. Could you tell who the hidden character in the opening ""You've Got a Friend In Me"" singing humming thing I did was?? If you can, you win my brothers car!!! 

P.S.S.S. WHAT'S YOU'RE FAVORITE PIXAR MOVIE???

P.S.S.S.S. Since it's November now MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!! (OR HAPPY CHRISTMAS if Merry is against your beliefs)

P.S.S.S.S.S. I don't get why some people are so against Merry

P.S.S.S.S.S.S. Like, what did she ever do to you??

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. What toy/thing growing up was YOUR Woody and/or Buzz??

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. I MUSTETH NOWETH GO TO BEDETH BECAUSEETH ITETH ISETH NOWETH ALMOSTETH 6amETH soooooooo GOOOOODNIGHT!!!!

And they are just my ATTEMPTS at the voices, and this is the 3rd set of 100 that I'm doing, so they are like the backups to the backups, soooooo a lot of them probably sound nothing like the real ones, xD

Oh yeah and I also I ""Attempted,"" some singing too since a few of you asked me to try some....(btw, I'm not what you would call a ""good,"" singer...or ""decent,"" haha, SO if you don't want your ears to bleed or explode you probably should not watch that part. It might kill you.....

P.S. THANKSYOU to all the nice peoples that left all the nice comments on my other voice impression videos!!!!! And even the peoples who watched them and left due to boredom!!!!!


P.S.S. I'm also sorry that I hasn't....haven't made a video in forever, but I was shot 8 times in my chest like the rapper 50 Cent and was recovering....ok, I'm exaggerating a little. I just had a cold. ""For two months? WTH kind of cold is that?""
Ok, I'm underexaggerating (is that a word, it's highlighted right now as I'm typing which means I either spelled it wrong or it's not a word....hmm.....what was I saying?)
OH YEAH, I had that ""coughing thingy,"" again (if you didn't see my first 100 voices video or saw it and clicked away or skipped the intro thingy, I had this cough that wouldn't go away for 4 months....) ANYWHOO, I had it...have it again, and it turns out I have some kind of cough asthma??? I also had Pneumonia and....well yeah that's pretty much it
So I'm sorry it took so long to put up another video. I hope you don't hate me.....

P.S.S.S.S.Z.S. I also filmed this over like 5 hours because I had to take a lot of breaks since my voice was getting all raspy and tired. I also made the stupid choice of singing at the END! WHY, would I do that? I mean I literally only ever sing in the shower or when I'm alone in my car, singing at the end of 70 something voice impressions isn't a great idea for someone who pretty much never sings IS IT!?!!? xD

I try a Queen Cover but only in bad guy voices ! ! !

HEY EVERYPEOPLES!! Sorry this video was a couple days late
I got requested to try another cover of Queen and since it's Valentines Day I figured why not make one about love featuring villains whom I can share my forever aloneness with!! YAY!!

But for realz, I feel like at least 80% of these villains wouldn't have become villains if they had just found love. Like with Moldywart, the real reason he's so violent is because he's self concious about his nose and feels like women won't accept him for his slight imperfection (Or the countless fatalties he's responsible for)

And of course by popular demands, I had to bring back Michael Myers. He was pretty busy with the tour he's planning, but I was able to bribe him with a blu ray copy of My Little Pony The Movie. 

I wonder when Disney is going to make a movie about a villain, but like where the villain actually wins...well I guess that technically could be Infinity War with Thanos...buuuuuuuut he didn't have a musical number, so it didn't feel like a true Disney movie villain

If you have any suggestions for songs or characters you'd like me to try in more Impression Covers, comment any requests below!! :D

P.S. OR if you'd like to see a full version of Michael Myers single, comment frishgabliggit to confuse everyone in the comments below
P.S.S. Also I'm just now realizing I put ""Crystal Lake Records"" when that's from Friday the 13th and not Halloween....maybe Jason is the producer...yeah, let's go with that
P.S.S.S. But for realz, isn't being single on Valentines Day just the bestest??
P.S.S.S.S. I'm definitely not being sarcastic at all 
P.S.S.S.S.S. I mean suuuuuuuure there's the constant reminder that ""HEY LOOK AT ALL THESE COUPLES!! THEY'RE IN RELATIONSHIPS AND YOU'RE NOT!!!"" which slowly eats away at my hopeless romantic soul
P.S.S.S.S.S.S. BUTT on the other hand...more chocolate for me. WHOO!!!!!
P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. BUTT for realz for realz I'm accepting applications for girlfriends. One girlfriend, not plural. I don't swing like that
P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. My only requirement is that you have to like Disney and not be a homicidal maniac
P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Most importantly the Disney one

My twitter and instagram are both Joshiiwuh (A few people wanted to know)

Anywhoo, this video is an...are...this video has impressions of all the Disney Princes, well all the ""Official,"" ones and then some other ones that I think should also be Princes (And that their GF's should be Princesses)
Disney, why you discriminate, eh??
But yeah, they're mostly SINGING impressions, for anyone who doesn't watch my videos, I don't exactly sing...pretty much ever, hehe (Only in the show and in some of my videos)
So I don't exactly sing a lot...that's what I'm saying, haha, and doing impressions can be hard but trying to sing in other voices is even harder especially for someone who...doesn't sing, xD
Just saying that if any of them don't sound like the Princes or the singing is pitchy or not goodish, sorry!!! :P
But a lot of parts of this video just have me singing in my normal voice or close to it because I either couldn't do a good impression or I forget that I was supposed to be doing an impression...

OH I almost forgotened (That's a word btw, I just made it up, and I'm a writer, so I think I'm allowed to) But if one of the people reading this is one of the people who keeps asking me if I will make more parodies and random videos like I used to instead of just impressions, yes...well I will still make impressions, but I wanted to start making other videos too again, then I could also put videos up faster.

P.S. Did you hear the random puppy barks when I did the Aladdin part???...yeah they're puppies, so they're not used to being around someone who sits in his room making lots of random noises...actually they aren't used to any noises, so they literally bark at everything...thanks puppies!! Hehehe, jk, we're cool, we're cool, it's all good, no worries, hakuna matata, one love, peace on earth, good will to all people or something, peace man, cowabunga, totally radical, narly, teenage mutant ninja turtles, heroes in a half shell, totally off topic

P.S.S.S. If you have any other impression suggestions that you wants to see, just leave it in the comments and I will see it and maybe possibly do it...or not...but I might if enough people want me to, so yeah!!!

P.S.S.S.S.S. Serious question, what does P.S. stand for??? I mean, do you even know??..if you're reading this still I mean...And if you are reading this still, I just want to say...hi...how are you, the names Flynn Ryder...OH did you ever see a preview for that one movie, Idk what it was called, but it came out a little after Tangled and it was about fairies or something, but there was one guy that looked exactly like Flynn Ryder, then again all you white people look alike to me, hehe

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Some of these impressions were longer than other ones...I only saw the older three movies (Snow White, Cinderella, and Sleeping Beauty) like once when I was really little, I saw them for a nickel at my local theatre, back then we could buy a barrel of pop kernals for only a haypenny. I'd share it with my sweetheart Amelia and we'd see the latest showing at our local theatre in the town, right next to Old Man Wilkens barbershop, where he'd put on a show before the show with his barbershop quartet, which included Elvis, Nicki Minaj, and my great Aunt Bartholemue. If you ask me, it was all a bunch of fiddle faddle, non-sense, but my gal seemed to enjoy it, so I'd pull up my trousers and pretend to enjoy it and HOLY SHITAKI MUSHROOMS, got a little off topic...sorry

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S That's how my G-Diddy talks (What me and my siblings call our Grandpa...we also call him Floodleding) We think he could be a rapper, he's got a wicked flow and some serious street cred too

IF YOU READ ALL THE WAY TO HERE, CONGRADULATIONS, YOU PROBABLY HAVE A LOT OF FREE TIME!!!...AND MIGHT BE BEING AFFECTED...EFFECTED....hmm, is it effected or affected, I never know...why couldn't they just make up another word for one of them?? Why does our language have to be so complimicated???"

It's me TRYING to sing/sound like some Disney characters, some famous singers, and a few other characters. 
Then I do a few short covers of some songs a few peoples asked me if I could sing in my regular voice (and let the self-consciousness kick in, haha...why am I laughing?)

Seriously though, I don't sing...ever...well I do sing, but ONLY when I'm alone. I don't mind my imaginary friends or the dead people I see hearing me, but I've got some serious issues with having people hear me, mostly just because I think I suck.
But I tried it just because some of you have been so nice and asked to hear my normal singing voice...at least I think that's my normal singing voice...honestly I don't even know what my normal talking or singing voices sound like anymore because I like talking in different voices so much.......

OH yeah, if you notice my shirt changing, it's because some of the impressions were from other impression videos I made and the rest I had to make in two days because I had sinusitis (stupid allergies) and I was coughing a lot...again...it's ok though I didn't die, unless you want me to, in which case, I'm sorry I disappointed you.

P.S. Sorry I also suck at guitar

P.S.S. I think I sound like a chubby chipmunk when I speed my voice up

P.S.S.S. Sorry to anyone who watches my videos but wants me to make more videos than I do, I have a lot of ideas for other types of videos, so I will try making more soon. Unless I get hit by lightning an die, then I won't because I would probably be dead...but not really, because I'm immune to lightning. (I've been electrocuted by those outlet thingys about 238 times.)
I'm surprised I don't have electric superpowers or something. That would be cool. Except I live in a save neighborhood, so there isn't any crime to fights. I guess I could always help people get cats out of trees or volunteer at retirement homes and help the elderly peoples with stuff, but then I would have to get a costume and everything and I don't know how to sew or make clothes and I can't just take Spiderman or Batman's costumes, that's copyright, they would sew me...sue me...

P.S.S.S.S.S. I hear this one girl tried to sue McDonalds because she spilled coffee on her lap and it was hot and the cup didn't say anywhere on it that it was hot. 

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. I have no idea how I ended up talking about McDonalds.....

Ba da da da da, it's food

(Rick Astley Cover)
Me trying to sing the Rick Roll song in Disney voices / impressions!!

HEY!! Merrry ChristmaHannaKwanzika!!! And/Or happy holidays of your choice or preference!!

This impression cover is of some song called Never Gonna Give You Up. Twas suggested by my sister Brandi (We're only fully related). I know, it's like some random unkown song that I'm guessing most of you probably have never heard, especially on a site like YouTube. 

I had to spend nearly 500 months memorizing the chorus to this song because it was so unfamiliar to me. At first I thought it was even in a different language, but then I realized that it wasn't and that I was actually not even in front of my laptop listening to the song but instead was watching the Spanish soap opera channel. 
I can't believe Miguel left Rosalina like that...he doesn't deserve her.

ANYWHOSE if you'd like to see me try more impression covers, just leave any suggestions in the comements below!! I promise I won't be biased and pick anyone related to me next time. I only had a couple days to put this video together, so sorry for the rushed-ness-ness of it then again maybe it's just my perfectionsims noticing the rushed-ness-ness.

Also do you think I need a new camera?? In my opinion, this one basically looks 4K, no wait, more like 16k. But maybe it's time I upgrade my 2011 camcorder. I mean technically I do have another camera that's more HD-y buuuuuuuuut I like to save that one for parodies and skits. But I can still get a new one for stuff like this I suppose. 
I'll just have to go empty out my piggy bank and then permanently borrow the other 99.9% from my brother

P.S. I'm in Disney World through Christmas so if you also happen to be here feel free to say hi!!!
P.S.S. I'll be the guy that looks like me
P.S.S.S. I'll probably be walking with other people that look kind of like me too
P.S.S.S.S. I call them my family or sometime my pack
P.S.S.S.S.S. We will probably have a squirrel walking with our pack too
P.S.S.S.S.S.S. His name is Yoshi, he's my sister Brandis' squirrel
P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Yes that's the same Brandi who suggested this video
P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. If you see her, tell her I said hi
P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. GTG now, Brandi wants me to go help her take her squirrel on a walk
P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. If you've read this far, Merry Christmashanakwanzika once more!!!! Hope you have a great holiday season!!!
P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. If you're read this this far, say a phrase from your favorite Disney movie and everyone else can try to guess what movie it's from or be confused by the random quote

Merry Chrismahanukkwanzika!!! Or whatever holiday you might be celebrating around this time of year!!!! Or if you're not celebrating any holiday, then merry December!!! Unless December is against your religion, then merry...life...

Anywho's, this video was originally supposed to be part of a ""12 days of Christmas,"" thingy that I was going to do, but I had to deal with a lot of stuff the past couple months (Some sad, some random, something there that wasn't there before) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAND medium story short, I ended up just being able to make this video...which I also had to put together pretty quickly, haha. 

One of the good things that happened was my family going down to Orlando for Christmas vacation this year. We're visiting this one place that owned by this giant talking mouse, you may have heard of it before. I think it's pretty new. 

I was planning on doing something like I did for the Halloween impression video I made, with multiple parodies within the impression video, and I did film a couple others the night before we left (Me and my sister were up until 4 AM filming stuff, haha) buuuuuuut I didn't really like how one of them ended up. I still might post the other one though. 

But I wanted to have at least something up, so like I was saying, I hope you enjoy. Please enjoy it. It will emotionally devastate me for years if you do not enjoy it. I will end up an old cat lady, but with guy parts instead of lady parts...or I guess an easier way of saying it would be a cat guy. Then again, I'm actually pretty allergic to cats, so I'd probably die of allergicness. 

Speaking of allergicness, odds are that Santa's got to have some kind of food allergy, right? And odds are that someone, somewhere in the world used or accidently added whatever it is that he's allergic to (Let's just say sulfuric acid) to his cookie. Unless of course Santa is a wizard and can just tell what's in each cookie by looking at it. Kind of like the lego's in the lego movie, you know the one with the legos? 

P.S. What's your favorite Christmas or holiday movie to watch every year? (Even if it's not Christmas/December related) 

P.S.S. Mine is probably either the Grinch ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooor Christmas Vacation.

P.S.S.S. OH!! Speaking of The Grinch, my youngest sister, the girl in this video, Brandi, is making a music video/cover of the song ""Where are you Christmas,"" FROM the movie, The Grinch, sooooooo if you want to check that out, you can just go check out her channel on Christmas day, which is when she's posting that one. (She's also posting Christmas songs every day all the way up to Christmas this month...well I guess she's BEEN doing that...she's almost done now, since it's almost Christmas) Her channel is called BrandiAlden1 if you want to check it out

P.S.S.S.S. Is/did anyone else (Depending on when you're reading this) go/going to Disney World for Christmas this year??? 

P.S.S.S.S.S. I met THE Mickey Mouse. Like 20 times...in 20 totally different places...that guys fast. I'm thinking he's got to be on roids or something. I mean, how else does he get to place to place so quickly?...well, I mean, he does have that magic hat....WAIT!!! MAGIC HAT!!! I solved it!!! In the movie Santa Clause, when you knock Santa off the roof and put on his clothes (Which sounds really weird when you think about it) you BECOME Santa. SOOOOOO, that means his clothes keep him from going into anabalactic shock due to his allergicness to sulfuric acid!!! HA!!! BOO YAH!!!! I just solved the world's greatest mystery!!!  I'm chilling like a villain with coolness right now, except I'm not evil, so since I just solved a mystery, I guess I'm Groovy, like Scooby (Doo) HA!! get it?? Do you get it?? Because I honestly don't, it's 5 AM now and I only got like 2 hours of sleep yesterday...or was it today...does today count as yesterday since I haven't gone to sleep? Or does it still count as tomorrow??

P.S.S.S.S.S. Always remember to drink your Ovaltine (Christmas movie reference, if you can guess what it's from, you win!!!"

This is found footage of someone who attempted the Knife Game Song...and FAILED.....as you probably guessed from the title of the video...

Unfortunately the injuries to the guy were fatal....permanently fatal.....
But he's feeling better now...........

CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 39 DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS OR YOU WILL PROBABLY GET HURT OR EVEN WORSE GET DIED!!!! yes I said get died, I know what I'm talking about, I took creative writing, I knows hows sentencs structers shuld bee AAAight?


I actually didn't cut myself at all making this, which is weird cuz I'm like the most clumsy person in the world, except when I do something dangerous, I never get hurt. It's simple stuff like walking down the stairs and then tripping and falling on top of a glass table covered in those ninja star things next to an electrical outlet which then explodes on my impact, sending me flying across the room and straight through the wall into the street, where I then get hit run over by a car, which accidently gets some part of the bottom caught on me and catches on fire, lighting me on fire too.
Just normal bad luck stuff like that.



oh yeah, and that wasn't really me singing....well I mean it was, but I made it all lower pitched so it sounded funny, kind of like I was going through puberty








P.S. I didn't swear a single time while making this video (even though the kids on my bus do it all the time), I used swear-savers like 
shitaki or hello or ask or crapakadabra

Isn't it weird how it's like already less than 20 days away from Christmas?? It was literally Halloween yesterday. I don't know about you, but September-December always goes by super fast for me. Which sucks because that's my favorite time of the year. SO I'm suggesting that we add 38 more days to December SOOOO that way there's more time to celebrate Christmas!!! (I mean technically I already use all of November to do that, but even then 55 days isn't enough for me haha)

Maybe I can ask the one dude in red for that as a present. You know the guy who chucks his body down the chimney when he break and enters your home and then reverse steals? (Well technically he also takes the cookies and milk, which could be considered stealing...BUT those are technically technically gifts so it's not really stealing)

I saw him at work though. For real. He was dressed in normal people clothes and I think he could tell I knew it was him because he walked away after he noticed me starring at him from behind the Christmas tree that I had been watching him from for the last 47 minutes.

P.S. Don't worry I know where his part time job is (He works at a mall) so I can just go find him there and continue to stare at him from behind a tree.
P.S.S. He like just sits in this chair all day in his full Santa costume and his booth EVEN says ""Meet Santa Claus""!!
P.S.S.S. I mean dude, could you BE any less discreet??
P.S.S.S.S. I'm a VERY observant person you know, so I KNEW within like the first 20 minutes of staring at the booth that Santa worked there
P.S.S.S.S.S. Do you have anything fun planned for the holidays?? (Comment below if you do!)
P.S.S.S.S.S.S. My family will be down in Disney World, so if you're there feel free to come stare at me from behind a tree too!!
P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. I really want it to snow because we've never really had a white Christmas, so if anyone could like order and transport 400 million pounds of snow for me to play in, I'd be very appreciative and be your bff forever
P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. AND if you've read this far MERRY CHRISTMAHANNAKWANZIKA!!!!

Welcome to the video description thingy!! 
This video was SUPPOSED to be up the week before the new Beauty and the Beast came out...also, there's like 15 minutes of Beauty and the Beast parodies that I couldn't use because the video would have been about 20 minutes long then, which I thought is probably a Liiiiiiiiitle too long for an impression video...somehow in my head when I estimated how long the whole video would be, I predicted 6 minutes...yeah, I'm really bad at estimicating stuff...haha...SORRY!!!

BUT anywho, if you do watch my videos, I'll be uploading one or two Beauty and the Beast parody videos sometime this week!!...ONLY about  a month after the movie came out!!! CLUTCH!!
Oh and also, sorry about the inconsistent lighting, I just bought one of those softboxes and ring lights and I'm still trying to figure out the best place to put them. Maybe I should just film in total darkness, that would cut back on the whole filming and setup part by a lot. Plus, then when I was editing, I wouldn't have to stare at my face for hours and hours and keep noticing how the lighting keeps changing. OR I could even just hire the actual actors to come do the voices and no one would even know, MUWAHAHAHAHAHAAAA!!! I will hire Emma Watson first...then I'll keep hiring her to keep doing more impressions of herself, just so that we can hang out, because she's awesome, because she's Emma Watson.

Do you think Beast ever gets paranoid that he's constantly being watched? That's probably why he stopped going out in public. Every time he went on a date, he would start talking to his spoon and his date would think he's crazy...I guess it could also have to do with the fact that he's basically a giant werewolf looking thing...but there's an easy solution for that, just say he's a cosplayer or only go out on Halloween and win a bunch of costume contests. 
Then again, Halloween wasn't around back then...and people in the olden days weren't exactly...smart...
First Guy ""That girl was reading! She must be a witch!""
Second Guy ""Well, there's only one way to be sure. Let's tie a rock to her feet and throw her in the water.""
First Guy ""What will that do?""
Second Guy ""Well, you see, witches float, because the water rejects their unnatural bodies, so if she sinks, then we know she's NOT a witch.""
First Guy ""What a completely logical and unflawed plan!! Genius!!""

YEP, that actually happened...dumb, right?? I mean, why would someone think water reject witches bodies?? That's so stupid, witches are just humans that happen to have magical powers and/or go to Hogwarts. And also, most witches are good, I mean, sure, some practice dark magic like he who shall not be named, but that kid with the lightning bolt and his friends, Ed Sheeran and Belle took care of him. 
P.S. Did you like my amazing Beast cosplay?? I made it all by myself...well technically I bought everything, so technically I didn't make a single thing...BUT, I put it all together like a pro costume designer person. They could have probably just used my Beast costume for the new movie
P.S.S. Speaking of the new movie, I was kind of surprised they didn't have Josh Gad do some kind of Olaf reference/Easter Egg thing, mostly just because, well he's Olaf, but also because in the original movie Lefou hid inside a snowman while hiding outside Belle's home. Man, Disney just can't get anything right, can they??
P.S.S.S. That was sarcasm...I'm totally obsessed with all things Disney, like on an unhealthy level. Me and my future wife will spontaneously break out into random Disney songs all day long and then someday when we have kids, they will only know how to communicate though spontaneously choreographed musical numbers. 
P.S.S.S.S. Thanks to my sister, Brandi for being in this video. You can check out her channel if you'd like. She's an insanely good singer who likes to sing songs on her song covering channel of songs. (BrandiAlden1)
P.S.S.S.S.S Those Beauty and the Beast parodies I was talking about will be up sometime this week
P.S.S.S.S.S.S. I feel like I already wrote that...
P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Oh well, too late to go back and double check. You know what they say! Why double check your work when you don't want to!!
P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S Seriously though, what's up with Mrs. Potts other 28 children?? I mean, you don't even see them at the end of the movie when everyone is human. CLEARLY, someone has a favorite child"

Me ""Attempting"" to sound like a lot of Marvel characters

WOAH!!! Two videos in two weeks!! It must be like the apocalypse or something because that never happens with me

SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO anywhose!! This is easily one of the most requested impression videos I""ve gotten requests for over the last few years XD aaaaaaaaaand I didn't make it until just now MOSTLY because I actually didn't even start getting into Marvel until...like a few months ago???

I know, I Know, I should be ashamed right?? (Well aside from the Guardians movies haha I always liked those....also it might be sort of obvious in this video which movies I've seen a lot more of or like more based on the number of characters from each movies I try XD)

Have you ever thought about how there's like a bajillion different superpowered or mutant beings in the Marvel Universe?? I mean, like at this point I feel like 4/5 kids in school have some kind of superpowers. If the actors contracts didnt end, within like 10 years there'd probably be like 115,248 members on the Avengers. I would basically be like a fan club or subscription you pay to be a part of.

Basically it would be like ""Do you have Superpowers? _____Yes  _____ No 
If you answered YES, you are officially an Avenger. If you answered NO, can you like at least shoot a bow and arrow or maybe are you like pretty good at kicking?? If so, you are also officially an Avenger""

P.S. I haven't seen Captain Marvel yet soooooooo sadly I did not add any of those 

P.S.S. Also like 30 others got cut from this because I was trying to keep it short haha

P.S.S.S. This is like my second week on the ""New video every week"" schedule aaaaaaaaand I don't know if I'll be able to keep it up XD I need to make shorter videos or something, mostly just because I'm still not big enough on YouTube to quit my job and do it full time sooooooooooo I don't have a lot of free time haha BUTT I'll still keep experimenting with the once a week thing

P.S.S.S.S. At least until I fail miserably and dieofexhaustion

P.S.S.S.S.S. NO SPOILERS IN THE COMMENTS!! YEAH EVEN YOU RANDOM PERSON WATCHING THIS 15 YEARS IN THE FUTURE!! SOME PEOPLE MIGHT STILL HAVE NOT SEEN ENDGAME YET, OK?!?!

P.S.S.S.S.S.S. If you're still reading this, whose your favorite character in the MCU???? (Dust versions of the characters count too, so like Dust Peter Parker or Dust Bucky count as characters)

Sorry for the delay haha. I officially have my new cameras now (I used one of them in this video, can you tell??? Also thanks to Brandi (My sister) for helping me get unstuck out of my temporary writers block I had while writing the lyrics (By writers block I mean that the song was originally about Quasi Modo going on a violent rampage and thanking every person he attacked for the opportunity to attack them, but Brandi said I should avoid that route)

I mean, I wasn't even going to make it seem like Quasi Modos' fault. The poor guy is just underfed by that creepy old guy and when you're underfed you sometimes start to hallucinate Like with his talking Gargoyle friends (They would vouch for him in court about how he was hallucinating Esmerelda, whom was actually a middle aged out of shape hobo man named Adamrelda, that he was underfed and the rampage wasn't his fault but that it was all the creepy old guys fault) The original script was about 84 pages long

P.S. Yes, I know that some of these weren't really villains, like Kronk or Loki or Bruce BUTT everyone in the video either did an evil-ish thing as some point OR...I just felt like putting them in it because my brain couldn't think of anyone else (Snow White barely missed the cut)
P.S.S. Whose your favorite Disney villain??
P.S.S.S. Leave them in the comments below!! (As well as a 40000 word essay on why they're your favorite. 
P.S.S.S.S. Or if you'd just like to skip the 40000 word part I'm pretty tight with the teacher and can blackmail me into getting you an A, I know a few secrets of mine that I won't want anyone to know about, so I'll be able to very easily blackmail myself 
P.S.S.S.S.S. Like basically about 30% of every time I've tried fliriting with girls. So much cringishness to chose from
P.S.S.S.S.S.S. BY THE WAY if you saw my last video, this is the one where you can win the beanie!!! So be sure to leave the comment that I mentioned in the last video (Don't worry, it's still mostly unused.

Sorry for the occasional off key-ness of this video!! I recorded most of the A capella in 2014 for another video I made (Nintendo Impressions) but then decided to try to make the whole thing into this video and came up with this...thing....

It's my first attempt at A capella though...from like 2 years ago...so sorry for the occasional off-key-ness of the Yoshis in this video. I'm probably much better at A capella now though. I was just a young boy back then, now I'm a man. A manly man whose manly in many manly ways. Aside from my boyish body, voice, and clothes. 

Originally this also had a short Pokemon, Kirby, and Metroid part to it too...the A capella, not the video. But if anyone likes it, I could always try another one...or even a non-Nintendo one. Probably something easy and beginner-A capella-ished-level, like Chandelier or something operatic or something by Mariah Carey or Whitney Houston, you know something that would probably be on the easier side since I'm still an A ca-beginner.

Also, even though it's hard to believe, those were not professionally made costumes. I get that they are incredibly realistic, but I actually put them together myself. I'm also a costume designing beginning too. 

The ""Stop motion,"" with the Mario figures was also made by a beginner...kind of...a non-beginner, with previous experience beginner. I know, I know, it's hard to tell that it was even stop motion. You probably thought it was straight up CGI, right? Nope, it was actually very well done stop motion. If you're experiencing shock from this revelation, I apologize. If your side effects continue for 72 hours, you might want to Google your symptoms. I tried that last week when I felt like I had a cold and I found out I didn't have a cold, but that I was actually pregnant. Yay for the internet!!! 

Oh and for those of you who are subscribed or watch my videos, I'm going to try to start making other types of videos, instead of just impression videos. (I will still keep making impression videos too).
But that way, it won't be like one video every month, haha. 

P.S. A pot was harmed in the making of this video

P.S.S. But we donated it's pot body 

P.S.S.S. It's in a better place now. 

P.S.S.S.S. In the back of a recycling truck

P.S.S.S.S.S. By the way, smashing pots is surprisingly fun. You should try it.

P.S.S.S.S.S.S. Maybe on your parents/friends/neighbors pots

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Oh, but make sure to ask for permission to violently smash their pots first.

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Or else they might sue you for poticide 

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Sorry about that last P.S. joke...

Since there have only been like 582 remixes of Old Town Road I thought it would be a good idea to make a new one but like with animated characters Unfortuantely, I was unable to get Lil Nas X or any of the actual voice actors to be part of the video and most of them also responded negatively to the blackmail, so I ended up having to just try to just do impressions of the characters myself.

No animals were hurt in the production of this video, however countless Joshuas were, we lost about 52 if I'm being honest. We were pretty reckless, like every 10 minutes another one would kick the bucket. Eventually we started having bets on if the next one would croack before lunch break or not hahahahahaha goooooood times goooood times

P.S. I have Norwegian in my ancestry, which is close to where How to Train Your Dragon, which means my ancestors had Dragons, which means I basically owned a Dragon and am a Dragon whisperer.

P.S.S. Did you like my Hiccup cosplay? It took nearly 2 WHOLE MINUTES to put together after I got the two pieces of clothing I used. First I had to get scissors, THEN I had to cut the brown part...TWO THINGS!!! I HAD TO DO TWO THINGS!!!

P.S.S. Well technically one because technically my sister cut it out for me, BUTT I did give the scissors and buy the two pieces of clothes so yeah, I'm ready to be a full time costume designer now Hollywood

But just kidding. If you want to make this kind of video too, feel free!!! (If you got the idea from me though, I guess it'd be cool or whatever if you like mentioned my channel, so that if you're video got like a bajillion views, then maybe I'd get one step closer to being able to do YouTube full time!!! ^_____^)

But honestly, don't feel pressure to share your newfound fame with the person who gave you the idea. I absolutely LOVE working in retail. IT. IS. JUST. SO. MUCH. FUN. I AM NOT BEING SARCASTIC AT ALL HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Anywhooose, I tried doing some requests in this video and it actually made picking impressions a lot easier, haha, so if you want to see me try more backwards impressions, leave a comment with a random character you'd like me to try and then something you want me to try saying in their voice. (I'm also going to be making a new 100 random voice impression video too, so I'll also accept regular voice impressions too!!)

You know, I've been thinking, that MAYBE, just MAYBE the reason it takes me so long to make my videos, aside from the fact that I have another job, is because when I'm editing my adhd likes to kick in and make me add like a bajillion things into the videos. This video was supposed to be like 3 minutes long XD. OH WELL!!! I hope you still somewhat enjoyed it!!

P.S. Did you sees my clue??

P.S.S. It was on the shelf

P.S.S.S.  It's the thing that looks like a fish

P.S.S.S.S. Next time I make one of these, I'm going to include more of the part of me trying to figure out the words, because that involved me making lots of funny sounds and facial expressions while trying to sound it out, and who doesn't enjoy others laughing at the expense of their dorkiness, am I right??

P.S.S.S.S.S. ALSO, if you'd like to see my sister try some more impressions, feel free to even leave a comment for her too!! Maybe like Batman or Gaston or Optimus Prime or Darth Vader, you know, something that she could easily do with her naturally high voice

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. OOOH!!! HEY!!! I just thought of another idea. WHAT IF. Me and my sister come up with random impressions each other has to try doing, but they're only voices that are like impossible for us to do!!?!??

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Have you seen that movie ""A quiet place yet??"" What happens if someone farts or has severe diarrhea?? 

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. If you've read this far, confuse people in the comments by typing Blubbagoopyblubbnubb

P.S. Did you like my cosplay that I was responsible for like less than 1% of? Haha seriously I literally just bought everything online from actual costume maker peoples 

P.S.S. I probably could have done better with the face paint stuff in some areas where I'm now noticing you could see my face

P.S.S.S. Also I noticed the Grinches face was kind of starting to slowly peel off while editing this. He must have had some kind of allergic reaction to that Who pudding, that stuff didn't look edible

P.S. Sorry about the ""poor,"" singing...I mean it was supposed to be ""weird,"" sounding, but it got pitchy in a few places....ok a lot of places,...OK THE ENTIRE THING! ARE YOU HAPPY???
But I still have this stupid cough that won't go away and it normally hurts to do that voice anyways....sooooooo that is why it sounds like cats getting run over by a lawn mower and being thrown into a garbage disposal....

P.S.S.S.  No, me and my brother don't normally dress like girls and dance like that....and no, unfortunately, neither one of those beautiful voices is my real singing voice...my real one is probably worse, lol....(sigh....depression)

Heeeeeeeey there, fellow YouTuber, welcome to the description box thingy. I don't usually make parodies like this, and by ""Don't usually,"" I mean never, well at least not by themselves like this one, though technically these ones were supposed to be part of my Beauty and the Beast impressions video, but I didn't use them because then the impression video would have been super long, so maybe these don't really count as solo parodies?? 

BUTT anywho, if you enjoyed this video, feel free to share it or like the video and then maybe I'll make more!! And by maybe, I mean I will make more parodies. I was using the maybe to get free likes and shares. 
Because I'm a YouTuber and that's like the YouTuber law or something. You know, the whole ""Don't forget to like and share...and...comment...and...subscribe...and follow me on my 347 other social media accounts!!! Please!!! I...I don't know why...I...I just need the love, I need to be loved!! I NEED TO BE LOVED!!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!""

There was one other Beauty and the Beast parody clip I didn't use, but that one was like 3-4 minutes long...probably, I haven't finished editing it yet...I'll get around to it...by next year...

OH, but I'm thinking I might start putting together unused or deleted videos like that one into some new kind of video on my channel, one filled with unused or deleted videos that I didn't use or deleted, which I shall call...Unused/Deleted Videos!! (Creative title, right??)

Have you ever thought about how weird it would be if one of the employees in the Beasts' castle were actually turned into toilets? Or even how awkward that would be?? 

I mean, would the Beast just decide to take his business outside or something?? And what about all the other employees?? Do they ever have to use the toilet anymore?? Or are they like unable to now?? Does Lumiere drop little wax deuces?? (These are the, crucially important, unanswered questions I think Disney needs to answer...)

If you're a normal watcher of my awkwardness, new impression stuffs coming soon to a YouTube's near you!!!

You know what I was randomly thinking about yesterday?? How we sleep for 1/3rd of our lives and spend another 1/3rd of our lives in school/working...that's pretty deep and kind of dark, isn't it?? WELL, anyways, after much thinkings with my brain, I have decided to spend the rest of my life as an immortal Vampire. THEN, I won't have to sleep as much and won't ever die!!...well unless someone puts a piece of wood in my heart of course...or if I stay out in the sun too long...and then there's the whole having to drink blood thing too, which I mean, isn't a bad thing, you know, if you're a vampire, I don't mean to offend your peoples, but drinking blood just isn't my thing, I'm just into food, you know??  

 P.S. If you would like to see me and my sister try to make more parodies, leave a comment below if you maybe have a request!!! X)

P.S.S. YES, that was real CGI animation that I used for the Mrs. Potts and Chip scene. That's why it looked so realistic. 

P.S.S.S. NO, those weren't actual strings tied around Mrs. Potts and Chip that I used to drag their bodies across the table, those were also CGI. They were CGI strings.

P.S.S.S.S. Chip was almost hurt in the making of this video

P.S.S.S.S.S. Seriously, he fell onto the ground multiple times and somehow didn't break

P.S.S.S.S.S.S. If he had broken, I'm sure it would have emotionally scarred me for life

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. You know, because Beauty and the Beast and Toy Story and Pixar make all of us psychologically believe literally everything in the world is alive and has feelings.

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.....Oh yeah, and Feelings also have feelings too....(Inside Out)

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. I wonder if the other inanimate objects that are alive have the feelings from Inside out inside of them...Or if the actual feelings, like Joy and Sadness have feelings...is there like a never ending group of feelings inside every feeling?? MORE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS DISNEY!!!!"

THIS IS MY FIRST TIME TRYING THIS KIND OF VIDEO, sooooo sorry about the bad editing and pitchiness in the video/song. I also just tried using my new Mic too, the Yeti, which is REALLY HQ and picks up EVERYTHING, xD

If I try more singing cover thingys, like maybe Jack Skellington or something, I will try to fix that, hehe

So, these are a few random singing impressions and short covers that didn't make it into an older voice impressions video I made because they were too long, I didn't like them a lot, or because I ended up just singing in my normal voice, which kind of turns it into a cover instead of an impression and that would be false advertising!!!!....well I guess all the impressions that suck would count as false advertising too???...well technically they are still impressions, just suckish ones...what were we talking about again?

I try to do impressions of every character in Smash Bros Ultimate!! 

Heyllo everypeoples!! Tis I!! That guy whom does those voice thingys
In todays episode he tries to sound like all the characters in Smash Bros Ultimate

Have you ever played Smash Bros?? If not you should. It's a game about friendship and family All these characters come from such diverse and different worlds and universes, yet despite their
many differences they all grow to love one another and learn the true meaning of friendship...by violently beating each other to the brink of dethhs

*Crowd says ""Awwwwwwww""

SO KIDS, if you're ever bored and want something fun to do with your friends or siblings to express how much you care about them, just play Super Smash Bros Ultimate!! 
I mean like in real life, not the game. The game is fun too, but they won't fully understand just how much you care unless you summon the literal ruler of the underworld in Pokemon, Giratina, to devour their souls or try to desintigrate them with a giant laser 

Kirby is EASILY the strongest character in the game. Don't come at me bro. He's basically a god
A pink, happy, squishy, destroyer of galaxies. The only time he loses is when he feels sorry for his puny, unsquishy, mortal competition

P.S. My favorite character is Yoshi though, I'm like obsessed

P.S.S. Borderline obsessed

P.S.S.S. Like my therapists keep telling me I have a dangerously unhealthy obsession with Yoshis

P.S.S.S.S. I don't see what's bad about my obsession

P.S.S.S.S.S. I mean the WORST thing I did was this ONE time, ONE FREAKING TIME, give or take a few others, that I ""Borrowed"" a few scientists in my basement and KINDLY asked them to create me my own herd of Yoshis against their will, like HOW is that affecting my life negatively???

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Well I mean there was that thing about how I wanted to enslave all of humanity using the Yoshi's for an army to basically pull a Planet of the Apes move on the world and get rid of all the Yoshi's to live amongst them for the rest of my life...but like aside from that??? Totally normal level of obsession

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Whose your favorite character in the game!!! OR out of all the characters in the game, whose your significant other? Mines Palutena. I called dibs already in the video, so HA....OK BYE!!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfNV0eCJ5E8

SO this was kind of a rough draft impression/video. If you haven't seen my Adventure Time impression, I ended up cutting an impression of the Ice King in that video because I thought the Ice King impression I recorded was really really bad, haha.

I'm still practicing, but plan on making another Ice King video in the future, like around 2030 at the latest. (I'm going to be a slight perfectionist with this impression, hehe.)

This video was supposed to kind of sort of somewhat be a re-enactment of the video tapes that Simon/Ice King recorded in Adventure Time...but with less re-enactment-ness and more not sticking to the script/improvisational-ness...

... also without an actual crown or non-lazy setting...hehe

But, HEY, at least I had my amazingly realistic wigs!! Right??? (I'm really good at keeping wigs in good shape)

Anyways, I'm hoping that if I keep practicing, I can get better at these impressions and make a longer video like this where I actual re-make the scenes from Adventure Time...

Also, in the next one, I will have an actual pet penguin, who will be named Gunter. 

I've seen penguins before at Sea World in Orlando, so obviously there are penguins somewhere on the east coast, which is cool, because I live on the east coast, so finding one should be easy. 

Worst case, I will just look for the nearest penguin adoption center or penguin pound and adopt one there. 

Do penguins need rabies shots too? I don't think I've ever seen a rabid penguin before. I bet it would probably still be cute though, even in its little rabid, flesh eating, zombie-like form. 

Forget human zombies, the real threat is zombified penguins!! (Zomguins) They would be waddling all cutely and totally catch everyone off guard because everyone would be mistaking their blubbery plumpness for friendliness. 

First, they will take over their natural habitat, the east coast, then they will slowly spread across the rest of the Us and Canada. Over time, they will learn how to somehow travel across water and eventually take over the world and spend the rest of time shattering every single bottle in the universe. 

No worries though, I will make sure to ask the next doctor/vet I see if I should have my pet penguin get a rabies shot or not. 

Because now I understand that the fate of the world depends on it. 
ZOMGUIN APOCALYPSE 2016!!!!!

P.S. These impressions were actually part of my newest 100 voice impressions video, which is almost finished, almost as in probably a couple days away

P.P.S. It's 100 something cartoon network impressions

P.P.P.S. I didn't want it to be too long, so I made this one into its own video

P.P.P.P.S. I read somewhere that after the first P.S. it's supposed to say P.P.S. which means every other video I've made has been fully of grammatically incorrect P.S's / P.P's

P.P.P.P.P.S. But then someone else said the exact opposite, so now I'm confused...

P.P.P.P.P.P.S. I should probably know this considering that I'm a creative writing major...

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. P.S.S. sounds cooler though and is easier to type, so I think that one is grammatically correct, because that's how grammatical correctnessness works."

ANYWHO, feel free to ask any questions you might have in the comments or send me a direct message. I've been asked for a while to make one of those types of videos, so as another way of saying sorry, I wanted to make one, at least for the people who wanted me to.   ^_____^

BUTT, also like this moving picture presentation said, I plan on making new types of videos too, hopefully that way I can upload stuff faster too. 

I really love making YouTube videos, so even though it's cliche to say, it means a lot to me anytime someone says they liked my videos or that I could somehow make their day better, even if only microscopically better!! Plus you guys just helped my channel get to 200,000 subscribers!!!! THAT'S SO WICKEDLY AWESOME!!!! THANK YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!

I plan on filming some impression videos this next week too, soooooo hopefully I can have something uploaded by later next week or next weekend!!! 

Speaking of weekend, I haven't had a weekend off from my job in over 7 months!! HAHAHAHA...oh golly gee willikers, I just LOVE my job sooooooooooo FREAKING much......I'm being sarcastic?? Pshh, what are you talking about!?!? I totally love my STUPID job, there isn't any FLIPPING sarcasm when I say that. Nonsense....

Does anyone else watch that show called Stranger Things??? Just because I heard it was good, but I haven't seen it. I can only focus on like 2 shows at the most at any time. 
Right now, Steven Universe is taking up one of those spots, so there is another empty one that I need to fill. Maybe I can just add it to my list of shows that I want to binge watch and catch up on. That list is only about 62 shows long, so I would probably see it before I die.
 
Speaking of death!! Did you notice my awesome animation in this video??!?!?! It looked so insanely profesh, right!??!!? (Profesh means professional, I just made that word up. It's okay, I'm allowed to, I'm a creative writing major, so I have like...authority...or....the street cred to do it) 

But, yeah, those super lengthy Belluh animations were pretty much my first animations. I made it on this dandy new, state of the art animating software called ""Microsoft Paint."" I don't know how many people know about this new way to animate stuff, but gosh, it only took me maybe 8 hours to do those short animations. Crazy, right!?!?! (Give or take 7 and a half hours) 

Our technology has come so far. I remember back in my day when we used to have to animate everything by hand...well technically we still do because we need our hands to use the computers and stuff. 
I also remember back in the day when we used to rent moving pictures from this local moving picture distributer called ""Blockbuster.""
Back then, we didn't have all this fiddle faddle technology that the younglings have these days. Why, I remember, we didn't even have color back then. Yep, every moving picture was in black and white...also everything else was in black and white. Trees, houses, food, people....well I guess some people are still in black and white. Haha, get it? Because our eyeballs have black and white in them???? Hahahaha

P.S. I think I'm getting close to the max amount of words you can have in this description thingy. I would know, it's happened to me before...five times...

P.S.S. They should let us write more. I mean, why does a video description have to be short? That's writer discrimination!!!

P.S.S.S. Did you know that public nudity is illegal in most places? I know!! Crazy, right?!!?! I mean, ALL I wanted to do was just go for a nice night time jog and really experience nature, you know? And then the next thing I know, cops show up and give me a piece of paper saying that I was ""Publicly Indecent."" Weird, right???

P.S.S.S.S. No pans were harmed in the process of making my sister unconscious. 

P.S.S.S.S.S. I tasted that cupcake I made...never taste the cupcake I made...

If you can't watch the video where you live, try going here: https://vimeo.com/152353627

My sister, Staci, grew up obsessed with Disney's movie, The Little Mermaid, so I wanted to try to help her live out one of her childhood dreams of being a Mermaid...but finding a real mermaid hasn't been crossed off my TO-DO-LIST yet....and none of the nearby grocery stores or fish markets sell severed mermaid tails, at least not that I know of....SO, I had to improvise. 

(On a side note, I still plan on finding a real mermaid someday and naming her Ariel, unless of course she already has a name, that's cool too.)

Either way, I will probably ask her out...unless she's a reverse mermaid, you know head/top half of fish with human legs...I still have plenty of time to figure this out.)

ANYWAYS, back to the Christmas thingy. I came up with an idea I thought would be cool. 

I had my sister, Brandi, help set up a room with stuffed animals of underwater creatures, with fake treasure/jewels scattered around, seashells, a bubble machine, and a cool light projection thingy that made the ceiling look like we were underwater. 

THEN, I bought some fleecy, blanket, material stuffs and had Brandi sew a mermaid tail blanket thing for my other sister, Staci. (The sister this present was for).

After everything was set up, I played a video on the T.V. with me convincingly dressed up as Ursula...or some male-version of Ursula...who still had parts of the female Ursula's ""Figure..."" (Clearly I have a gift for cosplay though, right?)  

The video started out with me kind of re-enacting the scene from The Little Mermaid, where Ursula convinces Ariel to become a human, but with me convincing her of the opposite, to become a mermaid.

I ended up asking Staci (The gift-receiving Sister), to unwrap a present underneath the couch she was sitting on. (Which was covered in a giant blue blanket to represent the underwater-ness of the setting).

In the present was the mermaid blanket tail that Brandi had made (The Gift-Assisting Sister). Staci put on the mermaid tail and sang the part where Ariel goes ""Ah, Ah, Ahh, Ah, Ahh, Ahhh..."" 
(You know, the part in this video where my other Sister, Brandi, sang. That wasn't originally there, just added it for this video for additional randomness, hehe)

Also, while she was singing and slipping the mermaid tail on, I stood in front of her and started violently shaking a blanket in front of her (To represent the mermaid transformation process, obviously).  

The last part of the video was me trying an impression of Tiny Tim (R.I.P.), whom I am convinced, serenades you upon death as you descend into the sky (Or wherever your respective beliefs and/or preferences takes or doesn't  you.)

Anyways, it was really fun to set up and embarrass myself in front of my family, which honestly is something I'm really good at. My family thought that I should further embarrass myself by posting the video on YouTube, so I did!! 
Well not all of it...but the ending...the whole thing was like 13 minutes or something...you can see more of it on Brandi's channel if you want, there is a slightly longer version on that one that I put up so my mom could share it with our relatives and stuff.

For those of you who watch my video or are subscribed to my channel, HEY!!! WHAT'S UP?!?!?! HOW WAS YOUR CHRISTMAHANNAKWANZIKAS AND/OR OTHER HOLIDAYS???? HOW MANY NEW YEARS RESOLUTIONS HAVE YOU ALREADY LOST??? I'M AT 12 SO FAR!!!! 

P.S. No, I did not film this underwater with my new GoPro camera, believe it or not, it was actually a Green Screen!! Crazy, right?? You probably had no idea that I was actually using a Green Screen, did you?? 

P.S.S. No, that wasn't my actual hair, believe it or not, those were actually wigs!!! Insane, right?? You probably had NO idea that those perfect condition wigs, that I toss in a box, were actually fake, did you??

P.S.S.S. Actually, Brandi did something referred to as ""Combing,"" to that one red one out before filming the new scenes with me...this ""Combing,"" apparently involves running these spiky needles on a stick through the hair repeatedly. TECHNOLOGY!!!! 

P.S.S.S.S. No, I did not undergo breast augmentation before filming this video, believe it or not, those were actually volleyballs under my shirt!!! Wicked camera trick, eh???

P.S.S.S.S.S. Yes, that was me singing...except for when my sister was singing...that was her singing....but anywhoo, the usual apologies for any pitchy-ness or whatever I may have messed up on. 99.9% of the time when I sing, it's when I'm alone...in the shower...or my car...you know, the usual stuff, mostly Britney Spears stuff to build up my street cred. I blast that sh#! with my windows down when I drive to work to establish my bad-ass-ness. THUG LIFE!!!

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.   I CAN'T WAIT FOR FINDING DORY TO COME OUT!!!!!!!!!! JUST KEEP SWIMMING, JUST KEEP SWIMMING!!!!!

I'm still working on my perfectionisms...I'm not very good at working on my perfectionisms :)

BUT, anywhooose I'm back again, sorry for continuously dying!!

Thiiiiiiiiis video was just a way of me getting back into the habit of making videos again, soooooo sorry to anyone who might have been expecting something a little more....original??

It's like if you're trying to get into the pool because it's cold but you don't want to jus jump in, so you have to stick your foot in first to slowly get used to it, which is a totally bad analogy, because I always do the exact opposite. Unless of course, we're talking Titanic level of coldness, in which case, I probably wouldn't just jump right into the water. Mostly because I'd already be in the water and not have a choice. But I'd help Rose get used the water by tipping over the door. Everyone knows you're colder when you get out of the water than when you're IN the water. Why do you think Rose was shaking so much while Jack was just peacefully sleeping?? 

Speaking of sleeping, it's 7 AM right now....and I haven't slept in like 24 hours now :)

See, I have this teeeeeeny tiny problem of adding more and more to videos until videos that were supposed to only be like 4 minutes long end up being...well, like over 10 minutes long haha.

I just don't understand how normal people make short videos. Not counting those vlogs where they are like 15-20 minutes long. You know, the ones where it says something on the video like ""BIGGEST SNOW FORT EVER!!!! ALMOST DIED!!! AVALANCHE!!! GALLONS OF BLOOD EVERYWHERE!!!! TOTAL CARNAGE!!!! SOME OLD LADY WAS CRUSHED BY THE AVALANCHE!!!"" and then like 16 minutes into the 20 minute video you finally see the snow fort and it's like only 2 feet high and gets knocked over by a Chihuahua?? You know, those kind of videos. 

I'm talking about the non-vloggy videos that other people make and somehow keep under my average of like 6 hours. ARE THEY LIKE FREAKING WARLOCKS OR WIZARDS OR SOMETHING!?!!??!??!??!??!?!??! I don't get it

Speaking of Wizards, guess whose going to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter this week??!?!?!?!?! :D

Lots of people probably

I'm not though. But I AM going to that other place that's right next to it....I forget what it's called. You know the one with the giant rat whose friends with the talking dog and goose?? 

But if you're reading this and you're going to be there, come say hello. I'll be somewhere within the 40 square miles of Disney World for like a week. I'll be the guy with the clothes on

P.S. Or not

P.S.S. Florida gets really hot, you know??

P.S.S.S. I've got to stay cool somehow

P.S.S.S.S. Donald Duck is like half naked all the time, so I honestly don't see the big deal.

P.S.S.S.S.S. And Pluto is like...always naked

P.S.S.S.S.S.S. I know, you're thinking, ""Well duh, he's a dog,"" but you're forgetting that Goofy is also a dog. He's just like some kind of advanced species of dog that can talk and walk.....but then again, Mickey and Donald and literally every other character in their world is a walking talking animal...so doesn't that mean that Pluto is the weird one????

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S BUT then again, I've seen OTHER character who had pet dogs.....Also, where are all the humans???? Was there like, some kind of war between animals and humans when they became advanced enough and then wiped out all of us??

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S OH MY GOD!!! THAT'S IT!!!!! THINK ABOUT IT!!!! WHAT ANIMAL IS MOST LOYAL TO HUMANS???? Dogs. The Dogs clearly fought along side us humans and when we were eliminated, the animals took the dogs as pets and eventually some of their breeds learned how to walk and talk while others...didn't

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. When the animal-human war happens, I'm teaming up with the animals. Sorry, I don't like humans (No offense to any reading this)

Hiya Georgie...or whatever your name is whoever happens to be reading this! This was my first time trying one of these drive thru prank thingys, soooooo we kind of totally cut one of the employees out of the video hahaha (Sorry about that Darren!!) but hope you still like it!!

I'm dealing with my coughing issue again too XD so I didn't quite have my full voice and couldn't really give my best impression of Pennywise, so sorry for that too haha

I wonder how many years it's been since Pennywise went away...I mean like in our world, not in the movie world. If there's anyone who happens to be from Maine, could you let us know in the comments if it's close to Pennywises' time to come back and 'do his thang'? (OR even better!! If you're part of a group that's being haunted by Pennywise could you just like vlog and record everything so we can all see you and your friends all getting picked off one by one or the ones who survives' slow decent into insanity??) THANKS!! :D

(Just make sure to keep Pennywises' slayings of your friends, family friendly otherwise YouTube might take your video down)

Did you know his name is Pennywise because he likes to collect pennies and snort them?? (The ""Wise,"" part is subjective...where he comes from snorting pennies is like nobel prize worthy...his species is kind of slow. Most of them actually drown because they like to look up into the sky when it's raining but forget to close their mouth or breath through their noses, that's why Pennywise is the last one left) 
- It, Chapter 3, The Prequel

P.S. Does Pennywise attack other towns in Maine?? Or does he only hang around Derry??

P.S.S. Have you seen It Chapter 2 yet?? If so did you like it? Was It good in It?? 

P.S.S.S. That's honestly probably why he's chasing that group of friends. They keep calling him It...I mean that's just hurtful to him

P.S.S.S.S. Also if you ever do a hidden camera or prank video always make sure to be nice ask everyone for their permission first
BE RESPECTFUL PEOPLES

P.S.S.S.S.S. If you have any suggestions for other characters you'd like to see me try at the dive thru just leave them in the comments below or like other peoples suggestions so I can see if there is one that's wanted more like maybe a life size cosplay of Godzilla at the drive thru or something easy like that

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. I skipped a few S's

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Shoutout to my sister Brandi for putting together like 99% of the costume hahaha 

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. There was a winner of the blue beanie giveaway I did!!! WHOOOOO!!! BUT I still have the yellow one to giveaway so I'll probably say the rules for how to win that one in the next video or two

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. If you've read this far comment what color balloon you'd like to float with if Pennywise visited you

OKIE DOKIE!!! SO this is a new-ish type of video for me!!!

(I know what you're thinking, ""Aren't like 82.3% of your videos impression videos???"")

But no, you're wrong. It's only 82.2998%

BUTT, while this TECHNICALLY is the type of video that someone MIGHT SUPPOSEDLY refer to as an ""Impression video,"" it is ALSO under 24 minutes long, which is a first for me when it comes to impression videos. 

It's like a new SHORTER and less editing filled Impression type of video!!!!! So that way I can make impression videos more often!!!! (I'll still be making my longer  impression videos too, BUT now I'll also start trying shorter ones like this!!!!)

(The ""100 impressions,"" ones and the more popular themed ones (Like say, ohhhh I dont know, maybe something like Pixar Impressions?????) will still be my normal feature film lengthed videos))

If there are any other themes for short impressions like this that you would like to see, mention it in the comments!!!!! (I mean, only if suggesting impression themes in the comments isn't against your personal or religious beliefs)
 
Honestly though, if you've seen the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, have you ever actually realized that literally every character that Elizabeth kissed in the movies kicked the bucket at some point????

 (OH, sorry. POST SPOILER ALERT!!!)

I have a theory that she's actually like the Grim Reaper...like a really, really attractive female version of the Grim Reaper....or Poison Ivy, because everyone that she kisses dies too. 

(The moral of the Pirates movies is that if you kiss the female version of the Grim Reaper, you will kick the bucket at some point in your life)

P.S. How amazing, on a scale of 2-245 was my Jack Sparrow cosplay???

P.S.S. Did you like my facial hair???

P.S.S.S. I grew it out for like 6 months just for this video

P.S.S.S.S. I've been getting so much attention from girls lately because of my manly facial hair

P.S.S.S.S.S. They've just been constantly staring at me whenever I go out in public

P.S.S.S.S.S.S. It's also possible they may be staring at me due to my newly formed medical condition of constantly screaming intensely at the top of my lungs whenever I'm in public due to my social anxiety.

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. But it's probably the facial hair

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Have you ever thought about how offensive the lyrics ""Yo ho, yo ho, a Pirates life for me,"" are??

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. If you've read this far, comment what your Pirate nickname would be if you were the captain of your own crew (You know, like ""Blackbeard,"" or ""Captain Hook,"" or ""Patchy,"" or ""Captain Crunch"")

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. I call dibs on Captain Pleezstabmee and my crew will have to address me by my full name before speaking to me. BUTT I will be a very kind captain and always try to grant the wishes and requests of my crew (As long as they use manners and ask me nicely)

Soooooooo I may have forgotten to upload the old footage of my ""Band,"" when I said I would last November...better late than never??? 
Anywhoo, I decided to try something different from an impression video, because those take a long time to edit. I still will make more impression videos, but this way, maybe I can upload more often...more oftener?? Oftenly??? Oftenerer????....considering I'm a Creative Writing major, I should probably know this....
Oh yeah, by the way, I messed up, that video of me and my ""band,"" was actually from 6 years ago, not 5. If you couldn't tell, I was the little girl on the drums. Man, I sure have grown up a lot in those last few decades. I've blossomed into a beautiful young lady, haven't I?? 
Also, I will probably never ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, never, ever, ever , never try being the lead singer in any kind of scream-o band, because I pretty much lost my voice for a few days after we made that video, haha. Singers in scream-o bands gots some serious skills....
Oooh, guess, what?? I just got this wicked plaque thingy in the mail for reaching 100,000 subscribers!!!! If you helped get my channel to 100,000 subscribers thank youuuuuuuu!!!!!!
I might be making a new video soon to say thank you for 100,000 subs, so if you have any random questions or request you wanted me to answer or things you wanted me to try, just message me or leave it in the comments!!!
This is probably the most on topic video description thingy that I have ever written....which is weird, because I had my video get really off topic, it was originally just going to be the short intro and then the old videos of my ""band,"" but then I kind of got off topic when I was filming and talking into the camera, so I just kept all the extra stuff.

P.S. The little girl on the drums, my ""baby,"" sister, is an insanely good singer so you should check out her channel ^_____^

P.S.S. Her name is Brandi Alden, so just type that in and you should find it...

P.S.S.S. I helped her record a cover of a Halloween type song that she will be putting up on her channel today or tomorrow (I also helped ""Sing,"" in a couple parts of the song...)

P.S.S.S.S.S. (By ""Sing,"" I mean making a random noises....one of the noises was a Shakira impression....if you can find it you win...something....shiny)

Ooh, by the way, I'm officially going as Snow White for Halloween...and by Snow White, I mean a Snow White whose dress is all torn up, covered in blood, with fangs and evil eyes who runs on all fours and uses her singing to lure helpless victims into the forest where she then feasts upon their souls....I may not be able to act out the last part.....

If you read all of this, Happy Halloween!!!! What are YOU being?!?!?"

OKIE DOKIE, sooooooooo I wasn't able to finish the YouTuber impression video by today, like I had hoped I would be able to, sooooooooo I decided to upload one of the random parodies from the video that was already finished to have at least something up, since I kind of sort of did say that I would have the YouTuber impression video finished by today....SORRY!!! 

BUTT, the impression video is more than half way finished. I'm like 98.2% sure that I can finish it before November, so it should be up next week.

THIS video is a parody, type, thing of the Don't Hug Me I'm Scared videos...but not really a parody because those are already parodies...if you've seen my other impression videos, I probably don't need to explain how my mind just wanders off and makes a random skit related to the impressions that I'm doing...but if you don't normally watch my impression videos, this is basically like an original song that was inspired by the DHMIS videos. Like a fan-film, but with a much lower budget and not quite as nice puppets!! 

But, yeah, I actually made this song all by myself. Well, my sister helped in some parts. I'll give her 2% credit (Even though she keeps refusing any credit at all. STOP BEING SO STUBBORN BRANDI!!!!!!)

She also convinced me to put this song on iTunes, sooooooo it should be up there pretty soon too. I think it takes them like a week to approve it or something before it's actually up. 

I'm basically one of those YouTubers who just wake up one day and are all randomly like, ""...I feel like being a singer now,"" and then they randomly  make a song.

But I made TWO songs, so I'm basically a pro already. (The other one is also from the impression video...it's a rap...in battle form...that is epic....hint, hint at one of the other impressions).

P.S. The Don't Hug Me I'm Scared songs are usually suuuuuper deep with their meanings, buuuuuuut I wrote and made this in like 1 day, so please forgive me for my lack of super deepness and meaningfulness

P.S.S. Although, extinction is a pretty deepful and meaningful topic

P.S.S.S. Except when talking about humans, because you know, they're my least favorite animal. 

P.S.S.S.S. (No offense if you're human)

P.S.S.S.S.S. I'll be totally honest, when the monkeys or robots or aliens take over, I'm probably switching sides. Sorry

P.S.S.S.S.S.S. Oh, but if dogs try to take over, I will DEFINITELY switch sides...not sure about cats...I mean, I like them more than dogs...but I feel like there is a chance they might use me as bait or something...eh, I'll still join them

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. HAPPY PRE-CHRISTMAS FOOD DAY!!!!

Rise and Shine sung by singers
Singing impressions

Heylo everypeoples!! Soooooooooooo this is a little different from my usual impression videos (DON'T WORRY, I HAVE A NEW 100 IMPRESSIONS VIDEO COMING NEXT WEEK!!) BUTT that one was taking a while to make soooooooooooooooo I decided to take a short video I made for Tik Tok and make it into a longer video so there wouldn't be as long of a wait for a new video because my video editor that I keep locked in the basement stopped working. Apparently you need to feed them or something???

ANYWHO musical prodigy Kylie Jenner recently had a video go viral of her performing an original song (for her child unit) to wake her from her slumber. 

Her child unit could only sit back in awe as she listened to her female parental unit serenade her with what is perhaps the greatest musical creation ever created in the history of time creations, ""Rise and Shine""

Rise and Shine is expected to win thousands of Grammys and even Oscars, just because it's THAT good. She already has a Nobel Peace prize on the way and has successfully ended world hunger and all wars from the absolute perfection of her original song. This is all even more impressive when you consider the absolutely devestating life that KyJen (That's her new nickname, she has one name now like Beyonce), that KyJen had to endure 

It wasn't easy for KyJen to become the youngest self-made billionaire of all time, many people may think:
""Oh, well if I was born into a billion dollar family that's watched and followed by hundreds and hundreds of millions of fans every single thus allowing me to earn likely millions and millions by the time I'm 12 for simply existing in this family, I could probably make a billion dollars too. I mean they get sponsors every 10 seconds and never have to even go to college or work a 9-5 job 5 days a week, so I don't think it's fair to say she's the youngest self-made billionaire of all time.""
                                               - KyJen haters

What these KyJen haters don't understand is that NOT having the pleasure of dealing with the intense stresses of getting good grades in school to ensure you get a job that pays you enough to not starve to death ISN'T as easy as it sounds. I mean SURE, she probably could have dropped out of preschool and never had to work for the rest of her life, but she KNEW she had a greater purpose in life. To become the worlds YOUNGEST EVER self-made
billionaire. So she took the measely 800 million she had saved up from the first 18 years of her life and she launched her own revolutionary business to teach the haters a lesson!!!

I have personally been inspired myself by KyJen to become the youngest self-made trillionaire. So if everyone reading this could please donate 5 million to my Kickstarter that would be awesome, thanks!!!

P.s. If you are a regular watcher-er of my videos, you might be all like ""BRUH!!! ISN'T THIS AN IMPRESSION VIDEO?!?! WHERE'S THE DISCLAIMER THINGY AT THE BEGINNING???"" well you see, techincally yes, it is an impression video, BUTT the disclaimer thingys are only for 100 impression videos and themed impression
videos like Marvel voices or Pixar voice or Peppa the Pig voices and since Kylie Jenner is not a theme and this was simply a trend, I was legally not allowed to add a disclaimer thingy

P.s.s. Also I forgot to add a disclaimer thingy

P.S.S.S. Please forgibs meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

P.S.S.S.S. I also might make a new singer voices impression video sometime sooooooooooon so if you'd also like to see me try (and probably fail) at another singer, feel free to SHuggest that in the comments too

P.S.S.S.S.S. Kidz Bop is the greatest musical experience of all time AFTER KyJen (Please forgive me for that caption in the video, I don't know what i was thinking)

P.S.S.S.S.S.S. If you're still reading this comment ""I'll have the number 3 with a side of chips"" to confuse others
in the comments...OK BYE!!

In this episode of me sitting alone in a room and making weird noises with my mouth whilst slowly slipping further and further into insanity, I'm trying to sound like 100 random characters that YOU suggested!!...well maybe not specifically you reading this, but other you's who watched my last video that left impressions requests in the comments

If you are one of the you's who left a request in the comments but you didn't see me use your request, don't worry, it's not because I hate you, it's just because I got a lot more requests than I thought I would and sadly I just had to make the difficult decision of which comments to take for a long walk in the woods to put down

BUTT don't worry, if you still wanted to request them again, just leave them in the comments again and I will try to revive as many offed comments that I put down

P.S. Feel free to be suuuuuuuuuuuuuper random too XD I enjoy the challenge and randomness of some of them

P.S.S. I need to learn how lighting 

P.S.S.S. My lighting suck

P.S.S.S.S. Maybe if I just set my entire room on fire then I won't have to worry about all the angles of the lighting because my whole room will be producing light from every angle!!! 

P.S.S.S.S.S. (Because of the fire)

P.S.S.S.S.S.S. Don't worry, I'll build up my immunity to fire before I do, I'll go swim in one of those incinerators like from the movie Toy Story 3

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. And don't worry about my don't worry LOL I won't forget to put 3 Alien toys from toy story into the giant crane thingy so they can save me before I over immunizize myself to the fire

Nothing in this video is fake. I know what you're thinking, ""The ghost is just you in a sheet with a poorly drawn face on it,"" but you're wrong. That face is not poorly drawn. Because it is not drawn at all. Because it is a REAL GHOST FACE!!!!!!!

I've never been properly trained in ghost detectiving, but after this experience, I think I might quit my job and just investimigate ghost full time, kind of like Scooby Doo, which kind of works out because I've been told I look like Shaggy. Some of my friends throughout my life have even called me Shaggy, like a nickname you know?

Also because they couldn't remember my name. Also most of them weren't actually friends with me. Just like classmates or co-workers who just happened to forget my name a lot. 

BUT I'LL SHOW THEM!!! After I release this ghost footage and it goes viral and has finished spreading around the world, proving ghosts to be real, skeptics will be all ""ERMAGHERD!!! GHOSTS ARE REAAAALLL!!! WE WERE SO TOTALLY WRONG!!!"" 
And then all the scientist people will give me a million dollars because I made an important scientific discovery. Kind of like that guy who got the footage of Bigfoot. 
You know why you never have heard from that guy again?? BECAAAAAUSE he's like a gazillionaire now!!!  He will go down in history as one of the most important scientifical people of all time, just like I will now also go down as one of the most scientifical peoples. 

Next up, I shall find real footage of mermaids...and if the girl mermaids are hot, I shall also marry one and call her Ariel and then we can live happily ever after with our cute little mutant 1/3rd fish babies. 
And Flouder and Sebastian will be my best friends and sing songs with me and watch the kids when me and the wife don't feel like watching them. Not because we don't like them, it's just that we haven't had much time alone as a couple since the kids were born, you know? It's super stressful being the parents of 1/3rd mutant fish babies!! 

That reminds me, before I set off on my quest to find my fish wife, I need to get a talking dog. OOH!! If I get one within the next day, I can totally go as Shaggy and Scooby for Halloween!!! Is anyone reading this a professional dog speaking coach?? Because if you are, I will totally pay you....hold on let me check my pocket.....FOURTEEN DOLLARS and SIXTEEN CENTS to train my Scooby Doo lookalike to talk. 

P.S. Speaking of Scooby Doo, those guys are pretty lucky that they've never ran into a bad guy who...you know, had like an actual weapon...I feel like the episodes might have ended a lot faster then

P.S.S. Is that an actual job?? Like solving mysteries?? Not like normal mysteries, but like mysteries where something in haunted and then someone hires you to come solve the mystery and then pull the mask off some old guy who was trying to scare everyone

P.S.S.S. If it's not, I'm totally up for starting a real life one right now. For reals. I call dibs on Shaggy, mostly just because I won't have to put any effort into changing my look whatsoever...and also because I get to hang out with a talking dog the whole time...and also the food

P.S.S.S.S. If you want to be part of my real life Scooby Doo gang, just say which character you want to be in the comments!! It's ok if there are more than one of each character. We can then have understudies that can take our place in the even that the original is not able to fulfill their mystery solving responsibilities. Or maybe we can just start a business and then have like 50 different groups all over the world solving mysteries and stuff. 

P.S.S.S.S.S. If you have read this far into the video description thingy and have ever experienced a supernaturalish thingy before, you know, one as supernaturalish or even MORE supernaturalish as the supernaturalishness that occurred in this supernatural video, share your supernaturalish story in the comments!!...you know, if you feel like it. I'm basically an expert at this point in all supernaturalish things, so I can probably tell you if your supernaturalishness is legit or not. But it probably is. Except for the evil scary possessionishy ones. Because if I say those ones aren't real, I will probably get possessed and that would really complicate my life, you know??

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Also, his name is Ghosty

OK BYE!!!

WHAT Was In The SKY?!?!)
Have you been wondering what it was that people saw in the sky in the movie Bird Box? 
Well we have the very scientifically accurate answer

HEY EVERYONE!! Did you see that one movie with that small family trying to survive the end of world apocalypse? You know, the one where there's these mysterious creatures that turn one of your senses into a weakness and make you have to live without that sense? 

No, not a Quiet Place. No, not Don't Speak. No, not the Happening. The one about the birds that are kept in that box on the river, you know Bird Box...oh....OHHHHHHHHH haha now I get the reference, because the movie is mainly about the birds. I'm stupid, I thought it was about Sandra Bullock and those very cleverly named kids.

If you haven't seen it though, you should totally watch it...not just because it's really good, but also because probably nothing in this parody video will make sense without you seeing the movie first haha

RANDOMLY QUICK SHOUTOUT TO SOPHIE AGAIN, WHO APPREARED IN THIS VIDEO!!!! ALSO RANDOMLY QUICK MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR MY CAMERA THAT DIED WHEN FILMING THIS!! 
(rip...)
Just kidding, it's cool it still works, well everything but the flip out touch screen thingy....that's just all black...now whenever I use it I have to use it like in the old fashion days when I have to actually look through the peep hole thingy. Isn't my camera terminology amazing??

So sorry for any inconsistencies with filming or lighting haha, that's mostly probably just because we  were no longer able to see ourselves when filming after a while XD

There were actually a couple of unused parody clips we filmed that didn't make it into this video and a bunch of bloops sooooooooo I'll probably make a blooper video pretty soon too!!

P.S. But for real, wasn't it rude of Sandra Bullock to just name her kids like that. I mean first of all what if one of them ended up finding out they're like transgender or something someday?? They'd have to change their name and the legal process of getting your name changed seems like...work...and I don't like work
P.S.S. BUT ALSO, what about Girls' Moms' Disney names she wanted to call Girl??? Like what the frick Sandra Bullock?!?! That nice non-able to fly out a window lady CLEARLY wanted her daughter to have a Disney Princess name!!! YOU HAD ONE JOB
P.S.S.S. Have you ever wondered what would happen if the aliens from A Quiet Place started invading WHILE Bird Box was happening too?? Then you would have to live in a world where you can't see or make noise
P.S.S.S.S. I hate politics, which is why I almost never include any in my videos. I don't like how it makes everyone just fight all the time. I mean, you're adults talk to each other in a mature way, stop arguing all day like you're 4 years old
P.S.S.S.S.S. Sorry, that was an insult to 4 year olds, 4 year olds are more mature than 88% of political peoples.
P.S.S.S.S.S.S. BUT one thing I think most people can agree on is that seeing what Expendable saw at the end of this video would be quite disturbing haha
P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Kermit the frog for next president BTW
P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. And Miss Piggy for 1st Lady
P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. OR even reversed haha
P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. If you're still reading this hello!!! :D If you ARE still reading this, what would be your survival strategy if you were in the Bird Box movie???
P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Happy 10 month early Leif Erikson Day 
P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Only 12 Sophie’s were harmed in the making of this video

Someone got into something they weren't supposed to, haha

(If you watch my other videos, this one is probably kind of random, but I thought it was funny, so I thought I would just share it because sharing cute animal videos makes the world a better place!!)

Feel free to share it with whomever you'd like!!!     ^_____^


AND NOW, A MESSAGE FROM OUR SPONSOR:
Every year, tens, upon tens of giant stuffed animal turtles viciously have holes dug into their bodies by dogs. 
But YOU can make a difference by remembering to never leave giant stuffed turtles unattended with dogs who have a past history of viciously digging holes in giant stuffed turtles bodies. 

Together, we can bring back this endangered stuffed animal species. (Only 0.1% of giant stuffed animals are estimated to be turtles)

If you'd like to make a donation to help support our great cause, you can donate ANY amount you'd like (Starting with our organizations' minimum accepted donation of $28,000), every penny counts...

Here at TNGSTPAPAOABNHWHTOSGSTPAPA (The National Giant Stuffed Turtle Protection And Preservation Agency Of America But Not Hawaii, Whom Has Their Own, Separate Giant Stuffed Turtle Protection And Preservation Agency), we pride ourselves on putting your donated money to great use. 

We promise to spend a MINIMUM of 25% of your donations on the protection and preservation of giant stuffed turtles. (NO REFUNDS)

If you ever encounter a wild giant stuffed turtle, do not approach it, as there is a 98% chance it will violently attack you and probably dig a hole into your body with its 500 razor sharp teeth. (82% of doctors recommend not having holes dug into your body with 500 razor sharp teeth)

P.S. The turtle has been fixed now and is in the process of recovering from his successful surgery

P.S.S. The hole has been sewn too

P.S.S.S. My youngest sister, Brandi won that turtle somewhere for winning some kind of game at an amusement park I think. We were going to just donate it, but then this happened and we figured most kids wouldn't want a giant stuffed animal turtle with a hole ripped in its back. 

P.S.S.S.S. One time I won a prize at an amusement park. 

P.S.S.S.S.S. It was a participation prize.

P.S.S.S.S.S.S. The girl running the game felt bad for me. 

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. If you're reading this and you could have any giant stuffed animal of any type of animal, which giant stuffed animal animal would you want?? (Unicorns, Dragons, and Hobos included)"

Did you see the new Cat Emperor movie yet??? If you didn't SPOILER ALERT: The animals talk
(Except Mufassa, he only talks the first half, then he just takes a nap the rest of the movie, at least that's
what my Mom always tells me)

Speaking of parents, have you ever thought about how technically Pumba and Timon raised simba?? I wonder who
the Mom between them is. Probably Pumbaa because he's very curvy and thicc. Timon is just like a twig, he clearly
doesn't lift bro

OH YEAH, I'm doing one of those beanie giveaways again!! Soooooooooooooooo if you want a chance to win I will be
explainicating how to winnnnnnnnn in my next video, which should be up sometime between 1 and 424,698 weeks!! 

If you have any suggestions for other themed impression videos feel free to leave any suggestions in the comments below pleaaaaaaaaaaaase, I am always in need-eth of more impression video ideas haha

P.S. Remember that scene where Simba said all the great kings of the past are like looking down on us?? What if that means that every star in the sky is actually a Bowlfassa alien monitoring our every movement??

P.S.S. And they're like just waiting for the right moment to strik and rain their Bowlish fury upon us non-Bowl mortals

P.S.S.S. They're probably waiting for us to raid Area 51

P.S.S.S.S. That's where the government peoples are holding the Bowlfassa leader captive

P.S.S.S.S.S. And as soon as we release him by accident, he will send a distress signal to his borl people

Unaired episode of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. Uh oh kids, look like Minnie ran over another selfie taker whilst taking a selfie herself whilst driving L O L  
Don't you just HATE when that happens?? I mean how INSENSITIVE and RUDE can some people be, can't you see we're trying to take our daily picture of our face to post on Instagram so that all our friends and family who follow us can remember what we look like???

(DISCLAIMER: DO NOT TAKE SELFIES OR BE ON YOUR PHONE WHILST DRIVING, IT'S DANGEROUS!!!....also you probably can't even get that good of an angle anyways, so maybe just wait to take selfies whilst driving a full sized Jet-Ski in the kiddie pool)

ANYWHO, here is a random video me and los sisterita (That's spanish for my sister...I think....I didn't do beino in Spanish ok?...) THAT me and my sister made on TikTok (If you have the TikToks and want to be my friend/stalk me, feel free to look me up!!! My name on there is Joshiiwuhhh but with 3 h's because two people took it already with 1 and 2 h's)

BUTT yeah, I'll be in Disney World for a week to visit my brother COUGH COUGH AND EXPLOIT HIS FREE DISNEY TICKETS BECAUSE HE WORKS THERE sooooooooooooo I wanted to put something up since I won't be able to for a few more days

BUTT when I get back I have a few new videos planned, like new new videos, new ones that are newer than the usual new ones I do!!!!!

P.S. If Disney sees this please don't me, I lubs you, I simply have a dark sense of humor to compensate for my life

P.S.S. No mystery mouseketools were harmed in the making of this

P.S.S.S. That guy we hit with the car was though

P.S.S.S.S. What??? We needed a corpse! 

P.S.S.S.S.S. Also yesterday was my birthdays so feel free to send me a panda or something, I accept all forms of panda payment, borrowed, stolen, etc....

(Posts a video for the first time in two months)
Oh sorry....I was....in the shower.......for two months........yeah

Haha soooooooooooooooooooooooo this was supposed to be up like 5029 weeks ago back when the live action Aladdin remake came out but then a series of unfortunate events happened (Like me forgetting to TURN ON THE MIC BEFORE RECORDING 4 HOURS OF FOOTAGE!!!!!!) and some other things that totally weren't my fault like that one

BUTT anywhooose meesa back again haha
(Also that's why it looks like different parts of the video were recorded on different days or why the camera angles move XD)

No animals were harmed in the making of this video but countless humans were. Like AT LEAST 3000. But it's cool they didn't mind. I mean, I didn't ask, but it's possible they didn't mind. I'd say like a 50-50 chance

Did you see that movie that came out like two months ago about the guy who finds the tea pot and then gets wishes from the blue man who lives in the tea pot? It seemed really similar to this other movie i saw back in the olden days called Aladdin, but they clearly weren't related because the new one was called Aladdin 2019 and all the people in thew one weren't cartoon people

No offense intended to cartoon peoples by the way. By that I mean offense to live action people, I like cartoon people more. Have you ever thought about how much more funish the world would be and how much more coolish it would look if everything was in cartoons??? 

Obviously cartoons are real, I mean I've seen Space Jam and Roger Rabbit BUTT the real question is where do we find them and how do we replace all the live action humans and building and stuff with cartoon humans and buildings and stuff?

P.S. If you had  3 wishes what would they beeeeeeee?

P.S.S. One of mine would be to give the genie short term memory loss like Dory so that he would keep forgetting that I had already used my wishes and I could have unlimited wishes then

P.S.S.S. Don't worry I would eventually set him free with my 62,928th wish in 63 years

P.S.S.S.S. Also the genies in both Aladdin movies totally ripped the Aladdins's's's's off

P.S.S.S.S.S. I mean he NEVER actually wished to be saved from the bottom of the ocean, CLEARLY he wanted to be down there, he was probably just practicing holding his breath or practicing stopping his heart

P.S.S.S.S.S.S. Neither one of the genies technically made the Aladdin's's's's actual princes, they only gave him a fashion makeover, so basically Genie only granted Aladdin one actual wish 
which was to set him free

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. If I were Aladdin I would totally sue, i mean Genie is awesome and everything, but like WHERE ARE MY TWO EXTRA WISHES BRO??? 

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. He could really use them, did you see the Palace he now lives in after marrying Jasmine? NOT A SINGLE TV ANYWHERE!!!!! I mean WHAT IS THIS, the 1300's????

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Yes that is my Abu stuffed animal, we're BFF's and we gossip 4 hours every night about girls

Sooooooooooo it's been a while again since I made one of these ""Video,"" things. BUTT, I'm going to try REAAAAAALLLYY hard to make stuff more often now. I work in retail, which has insanely random hours, which doesn't mix well when you have ADHD, which luckily I do, because it makes planning stuff and having a consistent schedule really difficult, and I mean, who DOESN'T want that, right?? Weirdos probably. Hah....

Actually, to be totally honest, I'm not really a planning type of person, I'm more of a do whatever my brain wants to do type of person, BUTT, I always want to make videos, BUTT my inconsistent job schedule messes with my brain, AND I need that to make videos because without it, most medical experts believe you'd have many difficulties in life. 

Which reminds me, my birthday was on March 10th!! Yay for me!!! I had another short scene I cut from this video because it involved it being my birthday, but another lovely thing that ADHD kindly does for you is making you REAAAAAALLLY bad at estimicating how long it will take to do things (Or in my case edit things). So looking back now, I realize that it probably wasn't the smartest idea to film everything one day before I wanted to upload it (Which was on my birthday)

I made a video year to say thanks for 200,000 subscribers where I was talking about how I would talk about why it takes me so long to upload videos, and this is kind of like that, BUTT, I thought of a cool idea for another video talking about ADHD, kind of like a parody type of thing. 

OOH, did you see some of my new decoration stuffs??? I'm trying to make the background look....less empty, ha. Also, I got some new lighting stuff too. I'm still experimenting with setup, but I feel like it's already a little better looking than before. (Well I mean, aside from my face, I can't really do anything about that, you know?? Unless you go the route of plastic surgery of course. But I feel like filling your face with plastic would be not good for your skin, right?? Then again, Barbie's face is 100% plastic and she doesn't look a day older than she did back in 1959. Ah, yes, the good old 50's. I remember it like it was around 30 years before I was born)

Speaking of the 50's, that's when Peter Pan came out...I mean in theatres...I'm pretty sure Peter is into Wendy...Then again, he's probably pretty lonely on that island...you know, I used to think, ""Hey, it would be cool to live in Neverland and never grow up, but now that I think of it, there were like only 6 girls on that island and most of them were mermaids...wait, actually, mermaids are hot, so yeah, I'll live there. Unless they're the kind from this one movie I saw about killer mermaids, I probably wouldn't want to date one of them..."" Oh yeah, there's also Tinkerbell and the fairies too. I ship Peter and Tinkerbell more than Wendy. 

That reminds me!!! I also almost forgot!!!! Warning: Do NOT consume large amounts of Fairy Dust. Fairy dust is intended to be absorbed through the skin only. Consuming large amounts of fairy dust can lead to severe hallucinating. Many who ingest Fairy Dust are under the belief that they can fly, when in fact, they CAN'T. Fairy Dust will ONLY work if it is placed upon your head and/or hair. 

P.S. Fairy Dust is illegal in 28 states

P.S.S. I AM going to plan on filming/editing and HOPEFULLY uploading a new impression video this week....if possible by Friday, HINT HINT

P.S.S.S. Also, the YouTuber I'mpressions video I talked about will be probably just 15-25 YouTuber impressions and I'll make it like a series, so that I can make them faster.

P.S.S.S.S.S. BUTT also because I'm REAAAAAAAAAALLY bad at estimating how long videos will end up being (Thank you again, ADHD), which is why my videos are usually like 20 minutes long, ha. SO if I do shorter impressions of YouTubers, then I can make the impressions a little longer each and not have the whole video be as long as a movie

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Speaking of movies, you know what movie I am totally excited to see and fan-man-ing over right now??? That new one with Emma Watson and the furry guy. HINT HINT. 
P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Hermione is playing a live action version of one of my cartoon crushes in a Disney movie that also happens to be a musical....yep, I'll be at the midnight premiere....

Soooooooooooo it's been a while since I uploaded a video.....again.....sorry.....again.....

Hopefully this video can kind of explain things a little better, buuuuuuuut basically I've been kind of stuck on one video in particular (YouTuber Impressions) and I've been having like writers block, but not actually writers block, more like a...YouTubers block??? Video makers block????

Also I was dealing with some personal stuff for a while... *cough cough, it was all a girls fault, cough cough*
(haha, kidding...I mean I'm kidding about it being her fault, XD...we're cool now, but I'm...I'm just VERY SENSITIVE OK!?!?! OK!!! I JUST WANNA BE LOVED!!!!! end of rant)   ^______^    (When I'm bummed my creative juices are like...non-existent, haha, but I'm better now)

ANYWHO, I have a ton of Halloween type video ideas that I wanted to make...and a lot of them are like ideas from last year or the year before that I never got a chance to make because my brain is very procrastinatish and perfectionish and ADHDish and wanting to make my impression videos as good as possible-ish, SOOOOOOOO I have-eth decide-eth to focus-eth on some of my Halloween videos-eth, and make an actual release date-eth for the YouTuber impressions and the Q&A video...that I have been promising for like...two years, haha

But yeah, long time no see!! How's life, how are the kids?

OH and as for the Halloween videos I mentioned in here, I have 6 that I want to try to make, at the very least, I'd say I'd be able to make 3 or 4 for sure...unless I die, then probably less than that...BUT I'm hoping to be able to make all 6, then be able to totally focus on the YouTuber impressions video and also the Q&A video!!!

P.S. This video was originally supposed to be under a minute long

P.S.S. Seriously, it was supposed to be just 2 short paragraphs that I wrote quickly saying the release dates and how I was going to make Halloween videos

P.S.S.S. I even timed myself and the whole thing should have been like 55 seconds exactly

P.S.S.S.S. As you can see, I have a tendency to get juuuuuuust a little off topic when I make videos whenever my brain starts to wonder off into la la land was a good movie but the ending kind of bummed me out just because I'm such a hopeless romantic movies can be so corny sometimes I like to pretend like I'm on a tv show kind of like the people in the office is that normal or am I starting to go crazy in love was a song by Beyonce is the person whom my friends say my butt most resembles

P.S.S.S.S.S.S. If you've doveth this far into my video description thingy, mention what you're going to be for Halloween!! OR what your favorite Halloween-ish movie is!!! Unless you don't want to!!! It's cool!!! It's not like my entire happiness in life is depending on you responding, therefore acknowledging my existence!!!

But like I said in the video, me and him (And you) are BASICALLY best friends now, so feel free to brag to everyone know you that you BASICALLY know and are BFF's with the real SpongeBob...well not BFF'S that role is reserved for Patrick....ok and 2nd is probably Gary....then maybe Sandy.....then Mr. Krabs…..OH and of course Squidward!!!! (SpongeBob liiiiikes Squidward)

So maybe like top 10 friends with him

P.S. NEW impression cover coming either this weekend or early next week like Monday/Tuesday 

P.S.S. ALSO a new type of impression video I'm working on will probably be up this week or next (Depending on when I make the impression cover)

P.S.S.S. ALSO ALSO did you notice how Tom Kenny basically said my Ice King cosplay was flawless and super professional and amazingly realistic and accurate?? He didn't actually say it, but it's pretty obvious I think that a cosplay of Ice King literally couldn't get any better than the one I did

P.S.S.S.S.S. What cartoon character is your spirit animal?

P.S.S.S.S.S.S. And are they edible? If so, would you eat them if you were stranded with them on a deserted island and ran out of spaghetti?

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Ok bye

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Just kidding I also forgot to mention in the video BUTT I promise the beanies are totally new and unused outside me using them to dust my room but I mean I HAD to since I'm allergic to dust!! If I didn't I would have become fatalized by the high amounts of dust and THEN there wouldn't even BE a beanie giveaway because I would be RIP-ed

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Ok now for real bye

Hmmhmmhm. Ta ta for now! And be sure to have fun at your local Happy Halloween gatherings this year. 
 
- Sincerely, Misses Mufflebuns 



OKIE DOKIE!!! Soooooooo this video was a little different from my usual impression videos I make, but I wanted to try to start making other types of random parody/skit videos like this one, so hopefully you like it! But if you're someone who prefers the impression videos, I have a new one coming in November!! (YouTuber impressions)

Also, if you saw the update video I made a few days ago, I was talking about how I wanted to plan on making 6 Halloween videos this year, but wasn't sure if it would be 6 because I'm really bad at estimicating how long it will take to film and edit videos, aaaaaaaaaaand yeah, this one took a little longer than I thought, haha. But I still think I can get another 2 -4 of them finished before Halloween. 

P.S. When we were filming the basketball scene, there were these construction guys that were doing work right outside the tennis court fence. One of them was either filming us or taking a picture, sooooo there might be a totally random picture or video of me dressed up as an old lady crossing over my sister online somewhere, haha

P.S.S. Also, it is insanely hard to move in that night gown thingy. I have no idea how actual Grandmothers cross people over or dunk in those things. I had to lower the hoop down to 9 feet because my legs couldn't move around as much so I couldn't jump as high...9 FEET!!! That's so embarrassing

P.S.S.S. Sorry if any parts of the video had really loud or quiet parts, me not so good with sound editing yet

P.S.S.S.S. I think I look pretty hot as an old lady, don't you?? I mean, usually I prefer girls a little closer to my age, but personally, I think I pull of the Grandmother look pretty well

P.S.S.S.S.S. No Pizza delivery people were actually harmed in the making of this video. 

P.S.S.S.S.S.S. I had to say Pizza delivery PEOPLE because it would be offensive to say Pizza men since women can be Pizza delivery people too

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Pizza delivery people are true heroes. Just like Firefighters, they save lives. By making people not have to move for food...well technically you have to still move to go get the pizza...but it's only like 10 feet, then you're set for the rest of the day...or week if you order like 20 of them...I really want some pizza now...but unfortunately I have to leave for my job, bleh....I wonder if I can have pizza delivered there??...

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. If you read this far, what's your favorite kind of pizza?? Mine is pineapple...yes I'm one of those people. WHAT?? A guy can't enjoy two things he enjoys together??? I like Pineapples AND I like Pizza, SOOOOO naturally, I like both together, what's wrong with that??

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. With cheese only

OKBYE!!!!

OH look!!! It's that guy who takes forever to make videos that you're subscribed to! Weren't you pretty sure he retired or something? I mean it's only been another 3 months since he last uploaded. (INSERT the ""it's been 84 years"" Titanic meme here)

Probably been so long you forgot what he looked like. I'll be honest, I had a baby. Not like with my non-existent wife, I just had one on my own. Thought it would be pretty fun. It wasn't. It was quite unpleasant and painful. Unfortunately you can't return them, even with a receipt so I decided to keep it and put it in a room with Kung Fu Panda playing on loop so  someday when it grows up it will be a master of Kung Fu and it can save us from doomsday like the avatar, except I won't draw a blue arrow on it's head because I feel like that would possibly cause it to have some self-conciousness issues, you know? Like it would wonder ""Why don't all the other kids have blue arrows drawn on their heads??"" 

Anywhose back to the guy in this video whom you're currently not watching to read this far into the enigma that is his thoughts. Why are ghosts white? Wouldn't it make more sense to be a darker color to better blend into the night time to stalk their enemies? Like Batman has it right, his enemies can't see him, but if a Ghost is haunting me and wants to sneak up on me or something I'm going to see a bright white sheet walking towards me in the middle of the night, you know??

Ok but realz now, sorry it's been a while, yes I said a while, I don't really dig the phrase it's been a minute, it confuzzles me. If someone says I'll be ready in a second or I'll be ready in a minute it means they'll be ready soon, also minute and while both have the same amount of syllables plus while has less letters. See, isn't it confuzzling???

Confuzzling on the other hand makes sense because it's fun to say 

P.S. I PINKY promise that it won't take 3 months for the next video 

P.S.S. I'm just working on my perfectionismsss
:DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

P.S.S.S. Maybe if i upload a really simple video like me opening a jar of pickles with no context and you guys help it get 58 million views i will then realize ""HEY i don't have to be perfectionistic with video making stuffs because they'll like whatever I upload"" 

P.S.S.S.S. Then maybe i could just start making videos of me opening things and it could be like my thing

P.S.S.S.S.S. Or maybe I can just exploit my Kung Fu Panda raised child and upload 427 vids of it everyday doing baby things 

P.S.S.S.S.S.S. Update: ok so apparently you're supposed to feed them

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. IF YOU'VE READED THIS FAR I HOPE YOU HAD AN AWESOME HALLOWEEN!!!!....which at the time of uploading this was now a full month agao hahahahaaa just randomly say what you were for Halloween in the comments with no context to confuzzle everyone

Say My Name Video Cover Beetlejuice

SOOOOOOOOOOOO my sister, Brandi, is a HUGE fan of Broadway and aspiring Broadway actress and she REAAAAALLY wanted to make a cover video of this song SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO being the super generous big brother I am, whose also not quite fully comfortable with singing, let alone trying to act like 
I was in a play that potentially over a thousand people would see, I said no....BUTT then she used her little sister powers and puppy-dog eyed me into saying yes....SHE BLACKMAILED ME GUYS!!! SHE BLACKMAILED ME!!!

Ok not entirely haha but if you aren't a huge fan of this type of video no worries, there's a brand new 100 voice impression video coming REAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLY soon...like as in later today XD

You should 100000% go check out my sisters channel, she's an INSANELY talented singer with INSANE choreographing
skills (She has choreographed multiple music video covers on her channel and also did most the choreographing in this video too!!!) Her channel is brandialden1

Also I tried my BESTESTEST to sound like the broadway Beetlejuice guy, Alex Brightman, buuuuuuuuuuut
he's apparently got this unique thing he can do with his vocal cords that's apparently rare where he can do the voice without damaging his throat...I mean plus he's also a professional singer XD soooooooooooooo I just decided to do something like halfway between my normal voice and his Beetlejuice voice (With like a little bit of the movie version too) so I didn't completely destroy my voice. I think I can do a decent impression in small doses but not for long before it starts to hurt XD


P.S. This video was supposed to be up before Halloween...that's how behind schedule I was with it XD

P.S.S. If youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu liked this video and want to see more live action covers like it (Possibly on my sisters channel) leave any suggestions belowwwwwwwwwwww

P.S.S.S. If like 50 thousand people all said Beetlejuice's name 3 times at the same time, would there be like a waiting list for him to show up for you?? 

P.S.S.S.S. Or if they all said it 6 times in a row would have have to appear and disappear in front of every single one of them??

P.S.S.S.S.S. OR or what if there was just like a huge crowd of thousands of people all saying his name over and over again at different speeds?? Would he be like strobe light appearing in every spot a hundred times per second?? 

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. I just tried saying his name 3 times guys, he didn't show up, which proves that there obviously is a waiting list. So if you people currently using him for your evil and/or homicidal deeds could please hurry up, that would be much appreciated

- END OF LYRICS -


Once critiqued by local family member, our mother, here's what she had to say about Pink Little Birdies:
""I'm...so...proud...just........so.........proud.........words can't even express how ""Proud,"" of you I am....""
(The critic asked to have the word proud specifically in quotation marks)

Another critic, who we most kindly agreed to keep anonymous, had to say this about Pink Little Birdies:
""Please...just let me go!!! I've already watched your video 287 times!!! (The critic was in tears at this point, likely from his pure amazement at what he was listening to) I have kids...I haven't eaten in 3 days......"" (The next 6 hours and 38 minutes of this critics' review was trimmed down for convenience to readers) 




Unfortunately, the Minions Of The Midnight Society broke up....a few days after their formation....but with enough support, it's entirely possible that they could come out of retirement. If you would like to see M.O.M.S. get back together, by donating a small monthly fee of $959.99, you can help make their drummers bail  and pay for the blatantly obvious instrumental lessons that they are so clearly in need of...or simply say something nice in the comments.  ^_____^


P.S. This was filmed in 2009, so that's the reason for the not-so-HD-quality

P.S.S. I already uploaded these two videos in another video, where I talked about these videos and then showed these videos, but got asked to upload them separately, so here you go :D

P.S.S.S. I'm pretty sure we only have like one or two of these instruments still....

P.S.S.S.S. No worries though, we have NEW, more POWERFUL instruments now!!! muwahahahahahahahaHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

P.S.S.S.S.S. Also, my brother has a triangle now"

I have to delay my next video until next Friday SO I decided to do a BEANIE GIVEAWAY!!

I know, I'm truly one of the most considerate and giving people in the world to donate one whole beanie to a person who may or may not be underprivileged. All you have to do is wait until my next video and then go comment ""I want the beanie"" on that video and I will randomly pick one of the peoples who comments that and then mail them their very own BEANIE!!

WARNING: Beanies can be aggressive when denied their preferred 20 meals a day or if you come off in any kind of confronting way to them. Beanies are responsible for nearly 15 human fatalities every 16 centuries. If you are allergic to be fatalicized by beanies, I recommend you seriously consider not being allergic to being fatalicized by beanies

P.S. If there are any other videos I've made in the past that you might like to see more of or like sequels of, just leave those suggestions in the comments below (OR any ideas, like for the gaming videos or maybe phone call impression prank stuff, preferably only stuff that wouldn't result in me getting arrested or fatalicized)
P.S.S. Were you able to get my super obvious clue about what the next song cover is???
P.S.S.S. I was a little too obvious wasn't I? Sorry, I suck at subtly
P.S.S.S.S. On a side note I think her and her ponytail and high notes are freaking adorable and I'd totally go out with her. We'd have a GRANDE time
P.S.S.S.S.S. More subtly 
P.S.S.S.S.S.S. I just got my two new children in the mail today
P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. By children I mean camera children
P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Without the word ""camera"" that sentence probably could be misinterpreted haha
P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. But they seem like really good children who will come in handy when I make them operate my new cameras that I also got in the mail

I try the Bean Boozled Challenge but with a twist!! I try eating EVERY flavor at the same time!
Eating Every Bad Bean Boozled Flavor At The Same Time!!

Please feel free to make me happy and like, comment, subscribe, and all that other stuff YouTubers always say. I'll also accept one live panda to keep as my child

HEY!!! I was challenged by someone to do that one Bean Boozled game, you know where you spin the thingy and it peer pressures you into eating a certain color of jelly bean which can be either
good or pure evil?? 
Anywho, then I thought that just doing the challenge the normal way probably wouldn't be super exciting since like a billion people probably have already tried it
SO I decided to try one of every flavor at the same time instead and then documented my entire experience, which is what you are now watching...then again you probably aren't watching it
if you're reading this, unless you're a really good eye multitasker and can like have one eye reading something below your nose while your other eye watches a video above your nose.

If you'd like me to try my own more complicated version of popular challenges or have a new creative one of your own feel free to leave any suggestions in the comments below!! I'm trying to
get into a habit up uploading more often and challenge videos are a lot easier to film and edit than my normal videos (But at the same time I like making the other ones more because I can
be more creative haha)

Oh I forgot to mention though, if you do have any challenge suggestions, please limit them to ones that would not result in my expiration. I'd really prefer to not expire for quite some time.
Like at least another 150 years

P.S. HAPPY HALLOWEEEEEEEN

P.S.S. Also in just 2 days MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!!!

P.S.S.S.S. Christmas starts November 1st...yes I'm one of those people, SO WHAT???

P.S.S.S.S.S. I literally just saw a pack of 8 reindeer in the woods last week devouring some random hunter, so clearly that was Santa's reindeer trying to stock up on protein to get in flying shape

P.S.S.S.S.S.S. IF YOU'RE READING THIS mention in the comments below what your favorite flavor of jelly bean is or what flavor you wish someone would invent!!

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. And if they don't sell jelly beans where you live or jelly beans are against your beliefs, just comment what you're favorite type of potato is (mashed, baked, scrambled, pie, juice, etc...)

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. If my cold goes away the next video on November 10th will be a new 100 Impressions video

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. But you'll have to find the clues hidden in this video or my last couple to find out what it is. It's basically impossible though. I bet no one can figure it out. I'm like Sherlock holmes with my clue hiding

SO we did this challenge where we found characters that each of us didn't know and then we hads to sounds likes thems.......assssssss you can see, I really haven't seen a lot of anime still hahaaaaaa i need to step up my game

I hear that back in the old days YouTubers used to do collabs like...in the same room together?? Then everything changed when the 2020 attacked. Only 2021 mastered all 12 and a half elements. Only he or she could defeat 2020, but that's of course only if we make it to 2021

I already put 400 grand on aliens wiping us out in September

P.S. it's non-refundable so i'm really counting on aliens eradicating all of hunanity so i don'tlose 400 grand

P.S.S. if anyone has ET or Macs (or Me's) digits can you text them and let them know we need an alien termination asap

P.S.S.S. if you'ze guys liked this video and want to see more collabs or vlog-ish videos like this (Which i really don't mind because it was fun and also required like a bajillion times less editing XD) just say so or like the video!! :D

P.S.S.S.S. don't worry even if you don't watch Ori's videos or follow us on instagram, we'll put something  soft below our windows so when we yeet ourselves out we land on something comfortable, like maybe a nice memory foam matress or a jagged boulder"

ARTIST: Minions Of The Midnight Society
SONG: The Frigid Ice Of The Window Panes' Depth Opens Up The Soul Of The Inevitable Darkness Of The Butterflies' Night (Acoustic Version)
YEAR : 2009
RECORD LABEL : Our Mom's Basement Studios
GENRE : Underground-Alternative-Electro-Indie-Pop-Metal 


Lyrics: Seeing as how this song is graced with, perhaps, the most inspirationally moving, unmatched poetical genius-ness, the necessity of lyrics in this song are irrelevant as they can be interpreted an unlimited number of ways.  


Notable Critiques: Each and every critic has been left completely speechless upon hearing this acoustic version of The Frigid Ice Of The Window Panes' Depth Opens Up The Soul Of The Inevitable Darkness Of The Butterflies' Night. 

It is said that upon hearing this song, some people have come to understand the meaning of the universe or life itself. One man, who wished to remain anonymous, claimed it was THIS song that helped him defeat the not-to-be-named-also-anonymous dark lord Voldemort.

 Like the tradition of wishing upon a star, it's been scientifically proven with scientifical things and stuff that wishing upon this star has a chance of making your wish come true. Feel free to leave your own interpretations of this song in the comments below. 



Unfortunately, the Minions Of The Midnight Society broke up....a few days after their formation....but with enough support, it's entirely possible that they could come out of retirement. If you would like to see M.O.M.S. get back together, by donating a small monthly fee of $959.99, you can help make their drummers bail  and pay for the blatantly obvious instrumental lessons that they are so clearly in need of...or simply say something nice in the comments.  ^_____^




P.S. This was filmed in 2009, so that's the reason for the not-so-HD-quality

P.S.S. I already uploaded these two videos in another video, where I talked about these videos and then showed these videos, but got asked to upload them separately, so here you go :D

P.S.S.S. I'm pretty sure we only have like one or two of these instruments still....

P.S.S.S.S. No worries though, we have NEW, more POWERFUL instruments now!!! muwahahahahahahahaHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

P.S.S.S.S.S. Also, my brother has a triangle now

P.S.S.S.S.S.S. The lead singer of this band would like to personally dedicate this song to Jennifer Lawrence

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. If you know someone, who knows someone, who knows someone, who knows someone, who knows someone, who knows someone, who knows someone, who knows someone, who knows someone, who knows someone, who knows someone, who knows someone, who knows someone, who knows someone, who knows someone, who knows someone, who knows someone, who knows someone, who knows someone, who knows Jennifer Lawrence, share this video with her!!!

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. If you would like to have this song performed at your wedding, The Minions Of The Midnight Society are now taking wedding gigs. 

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Except in Idaho, where M.O.M.S. is legally no longer allowed to perform at weddings."

Every year countless Pumpkins suffer at the hands of a primitive holiday tradition. If we don't act now, scientists predict that by the year 3927 Pumpkins might be slightly endangered. Please share this video with your friends and family to help spread Pumpkin Awareness amongst the masses. 

And remember, just because you've never witnessed Pumpkin Cruelty or experienced it yourself, doesn't mean that it doesn't exist...(Kind of like those ""Girlfriend,"" things I keep hearing people talk about, I'm sure they're not a myth and actually exist, mine probably just got lost or hit by a truck or something)

(Inserts 291st apology for not uploading in forever)
Soooooooo yeah sorry again...again.....again.....haha
For anyone who watches my stuff regularly (Well at the 6 videos a year regular pace I upload XD) I'm going to try my idea I had before to upload 3 times a month on the 10th, 20th, and 30th BUT this time my sister is going to manage my schedule, because as anyone with ADHD will tell you (Or as my psychologist told me ""Severely life crippling ADHD,"" lol such an over exaggerator)
I'm HOPING that maybe if I do upload more often I will get into a habit of it that maybe it could help my channel grow and then I could do YouTube full time!! Which would be a dream job!!! Or at the very least I wouldn't have to work at my job as much anymore haha

ALSO I'm actually already ahead of schedule believe it or not. Yeah, I totally filmed a video that is already ready to be uploaded basically. Impressive, right???

I've got a mini cold right now, BUT if my medicine starts to do it's FREAKING JOB, the 30th video MIGHT be a new 100 impressions video, if not, then that would probably just be the one on November 10th

P.S. A Pumpkin was harmed in the making of this video
P.S.S. Quite Brutally
P.S.S.S. This video took foreeeeeeeeeeveerrrrrrrr to make XD
P.S.S.S.S. Seriously, we're talking probably 20+ hours 
P.S.S.S.S.S. I dyed 39 times
P.S.S.S.S.S.S. Yes, I know that's the wrong way to spell dyed
P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. But I have to spell it like that because YouTube is super sensitive about words in descriptions and stuff now
P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. If I say any words that are even 0.000001% offensive they will literally send an asssssssasssssssin to end me
P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. There were a couple editing glitches in this video 
P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. But I mean, that's totally to be expected with a new $800 editing software on a new $1700 laptop, right??
P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Gosh, I just love technology so much
P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. If you've read this far, HI and comment below what you're going to be for Halloween AND/OR what your favorite spooky movie is!!!!

YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYY!!! 

It's supposed to be like a parody of that one movie about the talking dog and the French girl whose not actually French, if I didn't make it obvious enough. (It was originally supposed to be part of the Beauty and the Beast parodies that I made last year, which were supposed to be part of my Beauty and the Beast impression video, but both would have made the others super long....as you can see, I have a sliiiiiiight problem with keeping impression videos short like most other impression people on YouTube, haha)

But like seriously, have you ever thought about that one scene from the movie?? You know, the one where the Beast storms off into the West Wing and then someone has a wittle tempwuh tantwum and then starts destroying all the random furniture in his bedroom?? (And then at the same time, you can see that there were already lots of broken furnitures all over the bedroom, so you know that these temper tantrums are like a daily thing. But then you start to think for a second...wait...was...were those furnitures also his servants??!?!?

And you might be all like ""Well obviously not, because they don't have faces!!! Doy!!"" BUT, EARLIER in the movie, Lumiere was able to like turn his face off so he just looked like a candle...or maybe that was Cogsworth...it was one of them, either Candle man or Clock man turned off their face and just looked like normal furniture. AND, if I'm not mistaken the same thing happens when they fall asleep (Or maybe that's the new movie...OOOH, wait!!! In the new movie, SPOILER!!! when they all die at the end, their faces disappear and they become normal furniture again!!!)

WHICH MEANS THAT WHEN THE POSSESSED FURNITURE PEOPLES DIE AS FURNITURE, THEIR FACES DISSAPEAR, WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN WHY NONE OF THE FURNITURES IN BEASTS' TEMPER TANTRUM ROOM HAVE FACES, WHICH MEANS THAT BEAST HAS BEEN OFFING HIS OWN STAFF MEMBERS IN DAILY HISSY FITS!!!!!!!

ALSO, WHHHHYYYY do you think the Beast is SO against Belle seeing the West Wing???!?! IT'S BECAUSE HE FEELS LIKE HER REALIZING HE'S POTENTIALLY MURDERED DOZENS OF HIS OWN STAFF MIGHT DECREASE HIS CHANCES OF HER FALLING IN LOVE WITH HIM!!! IT ALL MAKES SENSE!!!!

...Or I guess it could just be like normal furniture too, that would also make sense.

P.S. This is actually only technically ONE of the 3 unused videos I mentioned in this video...

P.S.S. Another one I uploaded two days ago

P.S.S.S. The third one is Christmas themed, sooooooooo I will probably make that one around Christmas time

P.S.S.S.S. Speaking of Christmas time, I hate people

P.S.S.S.S.S.S LOL Just kidding, I like most people, it's just that my job makes me hate most people

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. I work in retail

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Lots of peoples are rude and hurtful towards my feelings when I'm just trying to do my job to be able to feed my poor children, you know???

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Ok, well I don't have any children, BUT I MIGHT SOMEDAY!! So...yeah, those non-nice people should try being more non-non-nicey to us retail workers, more like extras in Disney movies, you know, how they're always singing and dancing and stuff. That makes their insults and non-nicey-ness much less hurtful. Because then it's in the form of catchy lyrics

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Speaking of those extras in Disney movies, have you ever thought about how most people in your life are extras?? Like, you're the star, your family and friends are obviously co-stars, but then everyone else is either a background character or a cameo appearance.

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. AND NOW FOR A SNEAK PEAK OF TOMORROWS EPISODE OF JOSHUA (Cuts to montage of Joshua sleeping in bed from the hours of 4:32 AM - 8:51 PM. Then gets up, eats a cookie, takes a dump and goes back to sleep)

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. ONLY ON DISNEY CHANNEL (Joshua draws that sparkly Mickey head thing with his wand and the commercial ends)

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. If you've read this far: IF YOU HAD TO BE A POSSESSED FURNITURE THING, WHAT KIND OF POSSESSED FURNITURE THING WOULD YOU CHOSE TO BE!!!

Hey SO I have decided on a new official uploading schedule that I will be sticking to for the time being!! I will be uploading one new every every OTHER Friday, with AT LEAST one impression related video very month.

BUTT I will also sometimes make random surprise videos in between the every other Friday uploads too!!

Mostly just becasue I'm realizing that between my job and my current YouTube schedule it's just really hard to stick with the one video every 10 days (If you've ever made or edited videos before and watch mine reguarly I'm guessing you can probably tell I tend to go juuuuuuuuuuuuuuuust a little overboard haha)

BUTT this way I can stay ahead of schedule and not have to rush and try to make the best videos possible and maybe sometime down the road I'll get lucky and like have my channel get big enough to where I could maybe do YouTube full time and then finally get to quit my job! WHOOOO!!!!

OH but yeah new impression video this Friday. It's a famous song with me singing it in a bunch of famous characters voices. Also there will be some cosplay in the video too. Pretty amazing cosplay if I i do say so myself. I literally made every square inch of my costumes. And by made I mean bought. And by bought I mean purchased with my money. And by my money I mean my brothers money. And by my brothers money I mean his credit card. 

P.S. Do you like my christmas lights??
P.S.S. They're super symmetrical aren't they
P.S.S.S. For just $5000 I will PERSONALLY come Christmas-fy your house for you with my light hanging skillz
P.S.S.S.S. I also PERSONALLY guarantee that I can get it done it under 3 minutes with the same amazing results as my wall
P.S.S.S.S.S. There is a slight 46% chance that my decorating skillz might result in the start of a fire
P.S.S.S.S.S.S. By reading this disclaimer and paying me you are agreeing to let me potentially set your place of residence on fire
P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Did you know that most humans are allergic to fire?
P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. If you read this far what's your favorite Christmas movie??

And then I was like ""Well yeah, duh, of course, what do you think I'm filming right now??""
And then my brain was like ""You do realize that today is the 20th, right??""
Then I was all like ""..................oh................""

(If you didn't see my last video or have no idea whom I is and happen to just be visiting my channel-eth, basically I just decided to try to upload something every 10th, 20th, and 30th of every month to get into a better habit of making videos)

ANYWHO!!! In order to keep up with my new schedule, I dug up 3 old videos that I never ended up finishing and....well I finished them, haha. 

They were previously deemed unworthy of uploading by my perfectionistic brain, but apparently in order to overcome perfectionism, one must actually try to not be perfectionistic....that sounds stupid though, I don't buy it. 

BUT yeah, the other two deleted videos will be up tomorrow!! (Unless you're watching this in the future, then they're already up, unless I tragically died editing them on my laptop from an explosion caused by my proneness to accidently spilling drinks on technology)

AND the impression video will either be the video on the 30th, OR it will be like a bonus in between the 20th and 30th video, aside from the other video containing the other two deleted videos tomorrow or in the past depending on the time you are reading this....this is getting confusing now, so OK BYE

P.S. In case you couldn't tell, I'm a total Kidult  ^_____^

P.S.S. Also I'm now just realizing with autocorrect that I totally spelt kidult wrong in the video and title haha

P.S.S.S. Seriously though, like 92% of peoples over 18 seem to totally hate snow. 

P.S.S.S.S. Me and my sister saw like...2 kids in our neighborhood outside playing in the snow

P.S.S.S.S.S. AND, we totally outlasted them too, like by 7 hours

P.S.S.S.S.S.S. There was this one dude though that beat us

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. He was like taking a nap all day long face down in a pile of red snow right next to where the coyotes in our neighborhood live

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. My future wife must like snow

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Be an Anna

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Not an Elsa

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. I mean, because of the do you want to build a snowman song...

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Elsa's still cool

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. And technically she literally can MAKE snow so....hmm...

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. ALL, I'm asking is for my future wife to have the kiddultness of Anna as well as the slightly freakish mutant-like super powers of being able to summon snow from her fingers

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK???!?

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Did you know that snow is actually 96% organic and almost 61% gluten free???

P.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. If you're still reading this, randomly type ""Plumpaplootikus,"" to confuse anyone else who hasn't read this far

Also for anyone who watches my impressions or other videos, thank you!!!...and also I know a cover is...kind of random, but I've been asked a few times to try one, soooo I wanted to try getting over my nervousness and put one up 

Anyways, there was a reason I picked this song
In February 2014, my families dog, Bandi, my baby brother from another mother, passed away...I know it's corny and cliché, but he really was my best friend. It's cool how dogs will love you unconditionally no matter what you look like, how you act, how rich you are, or who you are, as long as you just give them attention...
Anyways, it's kind of random, but the day we got Bandit, we brought him home and had him sleep in a little box with blankets since he was a puppy. He ended up sleeping in my room the first night, which was also the first time I saw the movie Moulin Rouge (Which btw is REAAAAALY weird, hahaha, but I liked some of the music)
Anyways, that was the first time I heard this song and I liked it, so I guess I always thought of this song and Bandit together in a way, so I wanted to try doing a cover of it dedicated to Bandit
(I recorded this back in February, 2014 by the way, didn't put it up until August 2014, made it private and then because I was asked by someone REALLY nicely, decided to make it un-private...for now at least)

I literally don't sing unless I'm alone or in the shower, haha, so sorry for the pitchy parts in the song and any suckiness"

BUTT I found the magic life bringy-back-y rock from Harry Potter or as the locals say the ""Resurrection stone"" so now I'm back

BUTT after you go through losing a sasquatch wife to an evil demon baby like I did you realize that at the end of the day life is short and all that matters is not being decapitated by possessed infants

SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO now I'm just going to start only making videos for fun again and if I get lucky and can do it full time AND QUIT MY JOB then cool, Cool cool cool!!!!

And if not I can just have another demon baby with a sasquatch wife who was in a sewing camp cult and sell the possessed child to scientists for experiments and stuff and make some money that way. Or just sell my sasquatch wife because I think a real life big foot would go for a lot of money on amazon 

ANYWHO what's up how have you beeeeeen???????? Did you entirely forget of my existence or maybe just watched this and still have no idea of whom I is?????? 

P.S. I have to get used to YouTube editing again XD I've been making a lot of stuff on TikTok the last year and the editing is a lot different

P.S.S. OOOOOH!!! If you have the TikToks you should go check out my TikToks, my name on there is Joshiiwuhhh like my YouTubes but with 3 h's instead of 1

P.S.S.S. It's because someone already had tookened Joshiiwuh with one h and 2 h's 

P.S.S.S.S. If you have a possessed family member that needs to be exorcised try teaching them how to run on the treadmill, that's a pretty good cardio exercise so the demon will probs bounce once it realizes it's being exorcised super intensely and stuffs

P.S.S.S.S.S. BUTT FOR REAL, I fully blame Doc McStuffins for the fatality of my wife, I mean yeah sure, TECHNICALLY the demon child is the one who removed her head from her body BUTT you can't have a show that's supposed to teach you about doctor stuffs and NOT cover severed head reattatchment!!!

P.S.S.S.S.S.S. If youz haz readed this farz comment ""Welcome back Gladice"" to confuzzle everyone else
