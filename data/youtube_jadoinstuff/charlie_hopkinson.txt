I started learning impressions in 2012, at the age of 20. You can follow my full impressions journey in my new ‘How to do impressions’ tutorial series

After graduating from the University of Warwick in the summer 2013 he took 4 months out to concentrate on Youtube videos full time, including producing his most viewed video to date ‘Morgan Freeman and 40 other impressions’ with just over 12 million views. This foray into being a ‘full time Youtuber’ was cut short as he went travelling for 3 months before starting a 2 year teaching Graduate scheme with Charity ‘Teach First’.

While teaching he has performed in and narrated the 4 episode series ‘Lookalikes’ as Morgan Freeman. The show and the narration received a positive reception. The show aired on Channel 4 during the prime time slot of Friday 10pm for three weeks. It is now currently available on Netflix. Charlie also performed with other well known impressionists for an unaired pilot.

Charlie has worked for several prominent brands in relation to their products, including google and formula 1.

Since the summer of 2016 Charlie has once again dived into the world of YouTube, for the first time producing content on a weekly basis. He is also focusing on live performance; he has performed in live venues a total of 3 times to date.

His top impressions include:

Morgan Freeman (Red -Shawshank redemption)
Sir Ian McKellen (Gandalf – Lord of the Rings)
Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman – Breaking Bad)
Alan Rickman (Snape – Harry Potter)
Michael Caine (Alfred – Batman)
Jon Snow (Game of Thrones)

Will Tom Hardy come back as Alfie Solomons in the new season, season 6? no spoilers, and no fighting! I hope Aberama Gold is ok. He looked fine. Hopefully Finn and Michael grey disappear. The actors are fine, but the characters are so annoying! that would be some of the best moments of season 6 if that was the case.

Are the peaky blinders real? I watched a video on it and the answer was sort of. Also tommy quotes and edits, Tommy shelby, the real deal! The smoking 100 cigarettes a day real deal! let’s hope he staves off death like a certain alfie solomons! He crosses the line that bloke! too often! c'ero vicino

Peaky Blinders won a bunch of awards recently, should I get some awards for my impressions impersonations and all round voices?

So while we are in covid quarantine lockdown, whatever you want to call it. I was well overdue a haircut! as you can see. So what's the best haircut to get? the Cillian Murphy own brand, that's right the Tommy Shelby, unfortunately all I have is my sister with 3 youtube tutorials under here belt to give me this haircut. Oh and also we only have household objects to do it with! I could have gone for Arthur Shelby, as my hair was already long, but no, that would be cheating, so drink your whiskey, smoke your cigarettes, it's time to see my hair get butchered! Plus a few impressions, Alfie solomons, Inspector Campbell, Arhutr Shelby and Even Aberama Gold under the guise of Littlefinger.

Rough transcript

CHARLIE
Now then, pretty much since Thor ragnarok I've been a pretty big marvel fan so today, 7 of my best Marvel voice impressions I have to offer, please drop a like and let's do this.
THANOS
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be, chicken, frozen veg, some potatoes, a bit of butter, a balanced diet for all. Do you know what has happened since then? The children born, have known nothing but full bellies and clear blue skys. It's a paradise. Your planet was on the brink of collapse, I'm the one who stopped that.
BLACK PANTHER
Do not bother Miss romanoff, I will kill him myself, Sister, I did not freeze, I do not freeze, when the police say to me hey punk hands in the air, freeze, even then... well i freeze then, I mean this is america. I will do it for wakanda
BABY GROOT
I am groot (Doesn't count)
KORG
Tried to start a revolution but didn't print enough flyers, so nobody turned up, except my mum and her boyfriend, who I hate.
CAPTAIN AMERICA
If he's this far gone nat I should be the one to bring him in, because I'm the least likely to die trying. Yeah, big man in a suit of armour, take that off what are you?
RDJ
Billionaire, genius, Playboy philanthropist
THOR
Loki, I thought the world of you, i thought we were going to fight side by side forever, but at the end of the day you're you and I'm me, let's be honest our paths diverged a long time ago
LOKI
Yeah, it's probably best we never see each other again, brother, I did tell you not to trust me, hah, you must be truly desperate to come to me for help...
THANOS
Should have gone for the head *clicking montage*
THOR
This big muscly purple aubergine's telling me to go for the head. I know the aubergine, he's a friend from work. We work in accounts, we're going for mocktails after this"

Featuring Inspector campbell, Arthur Shelby, John Shelby, Aberama Gold, Alfie Solomons, Luca Changretta and Tommy Shelby.

Anyone looking forward to Season 6? I quite enjoyed peaky blinders season 5, is peaky blinders season 5 on Netflix yet? If anyone knows of a season 6 trailer let me know! Has the cast started filming for season 6 yet? How will Tommy react to Oswald Mosley plan going tits up? bit of a blooper! Red right hand by nick cave, what a song! what a soundtrack! huzzah! maybe I should cover it, oh wait I already did!

As you guys know I’m a big fan of Peaky Blinders, the cast, haircuts, whiskey, hair, outfits, hats, you name it, I like it. Thats why I do all the peaky blinder cast impressions (even the women!, Ada and Polly!), birmingham accent and all (or not in some cases). 

Will Tom Hardy come back as Alfie Solomons in the new season, season 6? no spoilers, and no fighting! I hope Aberama Gold is ok. He looked fine. Hopefully Finn and Michael grey disappear. The actors are fine, but the characters are so annoying! that would be some of the best moments of season 6 if that was the case.

Are the peaky blinders real? I watched a video on it and the answer was sort of. Also tommy quotes and edits, Tommy shelby, the real deal! The smoking 100 cigarettes a day real deal! let’s hope he staves off death like a certain alfie solomons! He crosses the line that bloke! too often! c'ero vicino
c'est quoi.
Do you want some ASMR, most of their voices are pretty much ASMR. a série
Peaky Blinders won a bunch of awards recently, should I get some awards for my impressions impersonations and all round voices? Maybe if I dressed up they’d give me the awards, behind the scenes and all that with cillian murphy and Tom hardy! Or maybe I’ll just wait until season 6 of peaky blinders is on DVD.

I started learning impressions in 2012, at the age of 20. You can follow my full impressions journey in my new ‘How to do impressions’ tutorial series

After graduating from the University of Warwick in the summer 2013 he took 4 months out to concentrate on Youtube videos full time, including producing his most viewed video to date ‘Morgan Freeman and 40 other impressions’ with just over 12 million views. This foray into being a ‘full time Youtuber’ was cut short as he went travelling for 3 months before starting a 2 year teaching Graduate scheme with Charity ‘Teach First’.

While teaching he has performed in and narrated the 4 episode series ‘Lookalikes’ as Morgan Freeman. The show and the narration received a positive reception. The show aired on Channel 4 during the prime time slot of Friday 10pm for three weeks. It is now currently available on Netflix. Charlie also performed with other well known impressionists for an unaired pilot.

Charlie has worked for several prominent brands in relation to their products, including google and formula 1.

Since the summer of 2016 Charlie has once again dived into the world of YouTube, for the first time producing content on a weekly basis. He is also focusing on live performance; he has performed in live venues a total of 3 times to date.

His top impressions include:

Morgan Freeman (Red -Shawshank redemption)
Sir Ian McKellen (Gandalf – Lord of the Rings)
Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman – Breaking Bad)

After graduating from the University of Warwick in the summer 2013 he took 4 months out to concentrate on Youtube videos full time, including producing his most viewed video to date ‘Morgan Freeman and 40 other impressions’ with just over 12 million views. This foray into being a ‘full time Youtuber’ was cut short as he went travelling for 3 months before starting a 2 year teaching Graduate scheme with Charity ‘Teach First’.

While teaching he has performed in and narrated the 4 episode series ‘Lookalikes’ as Morgan Freeman. The show and the narration received a positive reception. The show aired on Channel 4 during the prime time slot of Friday 10pm for three weeks. It is now currently available on Netflix. Charlie also performed with other well known impressionists for an unaired pilot.

Charlie has worked for several prominent brands in relation to their products, including google and formula 1.

Since the summer of 2016 Charlie has once again dived into the world of YouTube, for the first time producing content on a weekly basis. He is also focusing on live performance; he has performed in live venues a total of 3 times to date.

His top impressions include:

Morgan Freeman (Red -Shawshank redemption)
Sir Ian McKellen (Gandalf – Lord of the Rings)
Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman – Breaking Bad)
Alan Rickman (Snape – Harry Potter)
Michael Caine (Alfred – Batman)
Jon Snow (Game of Thrones)

How to do an amazing Arthur Shelby impression in easy steps, a tutorial for beginners. In this video I take you through the different steps I took to begin my Alfie Solomons impression. Waiting patiently for season 5...

Arthus Shelby is one of the easier ones to from the Peaky Blinders tv show. Easier that Cillian Murphy's tommy shelby and Tom Hardy's Alfie Solomons anyway. get your brummy accents out for this one!

Personally looking forward to Season 5, thought they are really making us wait for that release date. I may actually go back and watch the whole thing again. Good tune up ready for the series being dropped. Will Alfie Return, John in a flashback?

Anyone looking forward to Season 6? I quite enjoyed peaky blinders season 5, is peaky blinders season 5 on Netflix yet? If anyone knows of a season 6 trailer let me know! Has the cast started filming for season 6 yet? How will Tommy react to Oswald Mosley plan going tits up? bit of a blooper! Red right hand by nick cave, what a song! what a soundtrack! huzzah! maybe I should cover it, oh wait I already did!

As you guys know I’m a big fan of Peaky Blinders, the cast, haircuts, whiskey, hair, outfits, hats, you name it, I like it. Thats why I do all the peaky blinder cast impressions (even the women!, Ada and Polly!), birmingham accent and all (or not in some cases). 

Will Tom Hardy come back as Alfie Solomons in the new season, season 6? no spoilers, and no fighting! I hope Aberama Gold is ok. He looked fine. Hopefully Finn and Michael grey disappear. The actors are fine, but the characters are so annoying! that would be some of the best moments of season 6 if that was the case.

Are the peaky blinders real? I watched a video on it and the answer was sort of. and tommy quotes and edits, Tommy shelby, the real deal! The smoking 100 cigarettes a day real deal! let’s hope he staves off death like a certain alfie solomons! He crosses the line that bloke! too often! c'ero vicino
c'est quoi.
Do you want some ASMR, most of their voices are pretty much ASMR. a série
Peaky Blinders won a bunch of awards recently, should I get some awards for my impressions impersonations and all round voices? Maybe if I dressed up they’d give me the awards, behind the scenes and all that with cillian murphy and Tom hardy! Or maybe I’ll just wait until season 6 of peaky blinders is on DVD."

I started learning impressions in 2012, at the age of 20. You can follow my full impressions journey in my new ‘How to do impressions’ tutorial series

After graduating from the University of Warwick in the summer 2013 he took 4 months out to concentrate on Youtube videos full time, including producing his most viewed video to date ‘Morgan Freeman and 40 other impressions’ with just over 12 million views. This foray into being a ‘full time Youtuber’ was cut short as he went travelling for 3 months before starting a 2 year teaching Graduate scheme with Charity ‘Teach First’.

While teaching he has performed in and narrated the 4 episode series ‘Lookalikes’ as Morgan Freeman. The show and the narration received a positive reception. The show aired on Channel 4 during the prime time slot of Friday 10pm for three weeks. It is now currently available on Netflix. Charlie also performed with other well known impressionists for an unaired pilot.

Charlie has worked for several prominent brands in relation to their products, including google and formula 1.

Since the summer of 2016 Charlie has once again dived into the world of YouTube, for the first time producing content on a weekly basis. He is also focusing on live performance; he has performed in live venues a total of 3 times to date.

How to do an amazing Alfie Solomons impression in easy steps, a tutorial for beginners. IN this video I take you through the different steps I took to begin my Alfie Solomons impression.

Charlie Hopkinson is a comedic impressionist, impersonator, voice guy, whatever you want to call it who specialises in voices from current television shows and films. His standup is a character act about a retired maths teacher, his standup set includes impressions of Sir David Attenborough, Robin Williams, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Peaky Blinders, Tommy and Arthur Shelby and Gandalf from Lord of the Rings.

Anyone looking forward to Season 6? I quite enjoyed peaky blinders season 5, is peaky blinders season 5 on Netflix yet? If anyone knows of a season 6 trailer let me know! Has the cast started filming for season 6 yet? How will Tommy react to Oswald Mosley plan going tits up? bit of a blooper! Red right hand by nick cave, what a song! what a soundtrack! huzzah! maybe I should cover it, oh wait I already did!

As you guys know I’m a big fan of Peaky Blinders, the cast, haircuts, whiskey, hair, outfits, hats, you name it, I like it. Thats why I do all the peaky blinder cast impressions (even the women!, Ada and Polly!), birmingham accent and all (or not in some cases). 

Will Tom Hardy come back as Alfie Solomons in the new season, season 6? no spoilers, and no fighting! I hope Aberama Gold is ok. He looked fine. Hopefully Finn and Michael grey disappear. The actors are fine, but the characters are so annoying! that would be some of the best moments of season 6 if that was the case.

Are the peaky blinders real? I watched a video on it and the answer was sort of. and tommy quotes and edits, Tommy shelby, the real deal! The smoking 100 cigarettes a day real deal! let’s hope he staves off death like a certain alfie solomons! He crosses the line that bloke! too often! c'ero vicino
c'est quoi.
Do you want some ASMR, most of their voices are pretty much ASMR. a série
Peaky Blinders won a bunch of awards recently, should I get some awards for my impressions impersonations and all round voices? Maybe if I dressed up they’d give me the awards, behind the scenes and all that with cillian murphy and Tom hardy! Or maybe I’ll just wait until season 6 of peaky blinders is on DVD.

His standup is a character act about a retired maths teacher, his standup set includes impressions of Sir David Attenborough, Robin Williams, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Peaky Blinders, Tommy and Arthur Shelby and Gandalf from Lord of the Rings.

Always looking to update my roster I look to try out subscriber suggested impressions in the impressions challenge series before honing the best ones. Recently I have added Peaky Blinders and Marvel / Avengers characters to my arsenal!

I currently run a number of series including:
Impression Reels - The very best impressions I can do, Including LOTR, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Peaky Blinders, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Cartoons .etc
Impression Challenges - Trying out new impressions in a less polished form.
Impression Dramatic song covers - Voices of Reason.
Low Budget Animation - Stickman sketch remakes of Iconic Tv shows and movies.
How to do Impressions - An audience lead tutorial series where I attempt to pass on my Impressions knowledge.
Dubs - Comedic dubs of iconic scenes with new dialogue, (My Peaky Blinders and Lord of The Rings dubs have grossed over 6 million views on Facebook)
Standup - Clips from Standup sets I have performed over the last year.
Comedy Sketches - Comedy Sketches

I started learning impressions in 2012, at the age of 20. You can follow my full impressions journey in my new ‘How to do impressions’ tutorial series

After graduating from the University of Warwick in the summer 2013 he took 4 months out to concentrate on Youtube videos full time, including producing his most viewed video to date ‘Morgan Freeman and 40 other impressions’ with just over 12 million views. This foray into being a ‘full time Youtuber’ was cut short as he went travelling for 3 months before starting a 2 year teaching Graduate scheme with Charity ‘Teach First’.

While teaching he has performed in and narrated the 4 episode series ‘Lookalikes’ as Morgan Freeman. The show and the narration received a positive reception. The show aired on Channel 4 during the prime time slot of Friday 10pm for three weeks. It is now currently available on Netflix. Charlie also performed with other well known impressionists for an unaired pilot.

Charlie has worked for several prominent brands in relation to their products, including google and formula 1.

Since the summer of 2016 Charlie has once again dived into the world of YouTube, for the first time producing content on a weekly basis. He is also focusing on live performance; he has performed in live venues a total of 3 times to date.

His top impressions include:

Morgan Freeman (Red -Shawshank redemption)
Sir Ian McKellen (Gandalf – Lord of the Rings)
Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman – Breaking Bad)
Alan Rickman (Snape – Harry Potter)

Peaky Blinders season 5 is in full swing, so here are 2 new impressions from the new season plus a load of the old ones, featuring Cillian Murphy as Tommy Shelby, Oswald Mosley, Arthur Shelby, Jimmy McCavern of the Billy Boys, Polly Gray, Michael Gray, Inspector Campbell, Luca Changretta, John Shelby and Tom Hardy as Alfie Solomons.

Anyone looking forward to Season 6? I quite enjoyed peaky blinders season 5, is peaky blinders season 5 on Netflix yet? If anyone knows of a season 6 trailer let me know! Has the cast started filming for season 6 yet? How will Tommy react to Oswald Mosley plan going tits up? bit of a blooper! Red right hand by nick cave, what a song! what a soundtrack! huzzah! maybe I should cover it, oh wait I already did!

As you guys know I’m a big fan of Peaky Blinders, the cast, haircuts, whiskey, hair, outfits, hats, you name it, I like it. Thats why I do all the peaky blinder cast impressions (even the women!, Ada and Polly!), birmingham accent and all (or not in some cases). 

Will Tom Hardy come back as Alfie Solomons in the new season, season 6? no spoilers, and no fighting! I hope Aberama Gold is ok. He looked fine. Hopefully Finn and Michael grey disappear. The actors are fine, but the characters are so annoying! that would be some of the best moments of season 6 if that was the case.

Are the peaky blinders real? I watched a video on it and the answer was sort of. and tommy quotes and edits, Tommy shelby, the real deal! The smoking 100 cigarettes a day real deal! let’s hope he staves off death like a certain alfie solomons! He crosses the line that bloke! too often! c'ero vicino
c'est quoi.
Do you want some ASMR, most of their voices are pretty much ASMR. a série
Peaky Blinders won a bunch of awards recently, should I get some awards for my impressions impersonations and all round voices? Maybe if I dressed up they’d give me the awards, behind the scenes and all that with cillian murphy and Tom hardy! Or maybe I’ll just wait until season 6 of peaky blinders is on DVD.

Transcript: Tommy Shelby
There is god, and there are the peaky blinders, We own the ropes, who’s going to  hang us now eyy 

Oswald Mosely
Mr Shelby, You’ve come to my attention
I never seem to get to meet you without your family

Tommy
I understand you know a man called Jimmy McAvern

Oswald Mosely
May I take a cigarette

Tommy
Please

Oswald
Who on earth is Jimmy Mcavern

Tommy
Over the last 12 months you’ve been making approaches to various men across the country, that you think might be able to help you, with your cause, mccaverns is one of these men, he runs the east glasgow shipyards, He killed an associate of mine, I want to know what your strategy is

Oswald
That ones your brother, yes?

Arthur Shelby
That would be correct, welcome to Birmingham Mr Mosely, perhaps I can get you a lemonade, I squeezed it myself, I’m good at lemonade, Aint I tommy.

Tommy: What happened on that ship MIchael, in Belfast Harbour?

Michael Gray:
I’d like to introduce you to my wife, I betrayed you, but only in my heart, There was a time when there was a lot of money in that bank, and I thought I could leave, move to California, Hollywood.

Johnny Dogs:

The Billy Boys:
Drop the pea shooter son, a broken broom stops all gypsy curses mr Gold, did you not hear my song, these gentlemen are the billy boys

Aberama Gold:
You don’t know who your dealing with, I’ve been sent by the queen herself, Queen Mr Shelby, Queen Mr Tommy Shelby, it would be wise, not to harm me or my son.

Johnny Dogs:

Polly Gray: We all try to get away, but we never do, All children to be taken into our own institutions, If I come for you and I still might come for you, I will wear high heels so you can hear my footsteps on the cobblestones and have time to repent

Oswald Mosely:
England lives tonight and marches on"

After graduating from the University of Warwick in the summer 2013 he took 4 months out to concentrate on Youtube videos full time, including producing his most viewed video to date ‘Morgan Freeman and 40 other impressions’ with just over 12 million views. This foray into being a ‘full time Youtuber’ was cut short as he went travelling for 3 months before starting a 2 year teaching Graduate scheme with Charity ‘Teach First’.

While teaching he has performed in and narrated the 4 episode series ‘Lookalikes’ as Morgan Freeman. The show and the narration received a positive reception. The show aired on Channel 4 during the prime time slot of Friday 10pm for three weeks. It is now currently available on Netflix. Charlie also performed with other well known impressionists for an unaired pilot.

Charlie has worked for several prominent brands in relation to their products, including google and formula 1.

Since the summer of 2016 Charlie has once again dived into the world of YouTube, for the first time producing content on a weekly basis. He is also focusing on live performance; he has performed in live venues a total of 3 times to date.

Learn 7 tips for Peaky Blinders voice impressions. Featuring Inspector campbell, Arthur Shelby, John Shelby, Aberama Gold, Alfie Solomons, Luca Changretta and Tommy Shelby.

Anyone looking forward to Season 6? I quite enjoyed peaky blinders season 5, is peaky blinders season 5 on Netflix yet? If anyone knows of a season 6 trailer let me know! Has the cast started filming for season 6 yet? How will Tommy react to Oswald Mosley plan going tits up? bit of a blooper! Red right hand by nick cave, what a song! what a soundtrack! huzzah! maybe I should cover it, oh wait I already did!

As you guys know I’m a big fan of Peaky Blinders, the cast, haircuts, whiskey, hair, outfits, hats, you name it, I like it. Thats why I do all the peaky blinder cast impressions (even the women!, Ada and Polly!), birmingham accent and all (or not in some cases). 

Will Tom Hardy come back as Alfie Solomons in the new season, season 6? no spoilers, and no fighting! I hope Aberama Gold is ok. He looked fine. Hopefully Finn and Michael grey disappear. The actors are fine, but the characters are so annoying! that would be some of the best moments of season 6 if that was the case.

Are the peaky blinders real? I watched a video on it and the answer was sort of. Also tommy quotes and edits, Tommy shelby, the real deal! The smoking 100 cigarettes a day real deal! let’s hope he staves off death like a certain alfie solomons! He crosses the line that bloke! too often! c'ero vicino
c'est quoi.
Do you want some ASMR, most of their voices are pretty much ASMR. a série
Peaky Blinders won a bunch of awards recently, should I get some awards for my impressions impersonations and all round voices? Maybe if I dressed up they’d give me the awards, behind the scenes and all that with cillian murphy and Tom hardy! Or maybe I’ll just wait until season 6 of peaky blinders is on DVD.

Rough transcript:
Now then I am Charlie Hopkinson and I'm going to give you the 7 best tips, one for each character and soon you'll be nailing all the Peaky Blinder Impressions.
INTRO

CHARLIE
(2.Arfa's Shelby) Arfas voice is unhinged, He's got the loosest body language, so you want to practice doing the Arthur Walk, (Berlin clip) swinging those arms, and loosening up the neck. Once you can immediately adopt this body language your Arthur impression will be fire emoji or something.
CHARLIE
(Aberama Gold) I assume you can do a little finger impression, just do that. No, really, you want to take a southern irish accent, and imagine as you're doing it focus what it's like to be in love with sansa, no but seriously, I want you to focus on the mouth shape. Imagine your mouth is an instrument, it's like hole end, the end with the hole in it, the shape of it, alters the sound that comes out. My Tip for Aberama gold is keep your lips pursed into a slightly lopsided smile, and deliver it halfway between regular talking and a whisper. and then Imagine yourself climbing a ladder, a chaos ladder.
CHARLIE
(John Shelby) Probably the weakest of the ones I can do. But it's the most brummy of the accents. Here's a clip you probably remember from the show. Remember that episode, the one where they watch the champions league final and Tommy's william hill account get's blocked. For John, start with your tommy impression, add more to the crummy accent, but Add a quality that's halfway between a gangster and an impudent child. Nah I aint doing it, I won't eat my damn vegetables. I want Sweets, sweets and a bag of cocaine.
CHARLIE
(Alfie Solomons) Alfie, Alfie Solomons, yeah, right. One trick you can use for Alfie is to look forward, talking, while they're there and then at the last moment, look them in the eye. It's a power play right. But the key thing for Alfie, is to add the grunts and noises around it, here are some you might want to add. (Grunt super cut).
CHARLIE
(Luca Changretta) Do a Marlon Brando impression.
CHARLIE
(Tommy Shelby) I think the Tommy shelby sounds best when it is 30% of the way between a whisper and Here's an exercise I want you to try when doing Tommy Shelby to say the words at almost a whisper, and just say a shadow of the word, yeah, alright, ok,  yeah, everybody, agreed, yeah. If you do your normal Tommy Shelby impression, and then every so often go into this whispery mode you'll find it really starts to take shape. (Outside) Also, pin your shoulders back and stick your neck out, that should be the default position for delivering Tommy Shelby impression."

So while we are in covid quarantine lockdown, whatever you want to call it. with my new cillian murphy- tommy shelby haircut. What's the best haircut to get? the Cillian Murphy own brand, that's right the Tommy Shelby, unfortunately all I have is my sister with 3 youtube tutorials under here belt to give me that haircut. Oh and also we only have household objects to do it with! I could have gone for Arthur Shelby, as my hair was already long, but no, that would be cheating, so drink your whiskey, smoke your cigarettes, it's time to see my hair get butchered! Plus a few impressions, Alfie solomons, Inspector Campbell, Arhutr Shelby and Even Aberama Gold under the guise of Littlefinger. But now I'm ringing Peaky blinders lookalikes for this fun lip sync video.

Anyone looking forward to Season 6? I quite enjoyed peaky blinders season 5, is peaky blinders season 5 on Netflix yet? It is on Netflix apparently. If anyone knows of a season 6 trailer let me know!

Rough transcript:

Do you know what has happened since then, the children born, have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies, it’s a paradise

Opening quote:
Resources: Clips Stephen Colbert, for a reason I’ll discuss later
Accent: La Accent, but also, all powerful alien, so you know
Tone: Deep and bass, from the throat, quiet and soft
Speech pattern: Slow, emphasis on words, Allow the words to come up from the throat, then delay before releasing them, ‘Children Born have known nothing…’ The trail off, ‘you should have gone for the head’
Trigger words: Born, Gamora
Body Language: relatable goal carry a burden, essentially a conservationist, he’s like david attenborough but with a big glove and likes genocide, so he’s pained, and also rather strong, he’s a big strong muscle boy, try and broaden yourself out, one step ahead at all times, you want that burden on your shoulders feeling to come through in your voice, like a strain. Not too dissimilarilar to morgan freeman, if you imagine you have something in your mouth, it gives that 






Case Study: Studying the actor for a character

trickle through and pronunciation, compare where it is the same, but also where it is different because you can hear the words that have a clear accent.

goes the same for cartoon character in studio, don’t practice from the cartoon, practice from the in studio clips, as you can see the physical steps they go to, to create this new voice"

Impressions of your favourite Peaky Blinder characters, mostly the women! Polly grey, Ada Shelby, Esme and Grace.

Anyone looking forward to Season 6? I quite enjoyed peaky blinders season 5, is peaky blinders season 5 on Netflix yet? If anyone knows of a season 6 trailer let me know! Has the cast started filming for season 6 yet? How will Tommy react to Oswald Mosley plan going tits up? bit of a blooper! Red right hand by nick cave, what a song! what a soundtrack! huzzah! maybe I should cover it, oh wait I already did!

As you guys know I’m a big fan of Peaky Blinders, the cast, haircuts, whiskey, hair, outfits, hats, you name it, I like it. Thats why I do all the peaky blinder cast impressions (even the women!, Ada and Polly!), birmingham accent and all (or not in some cases). 

Will Tom Hardy come back as Alfie Solomons in the new season, season 6? no spoilers, and no fighting! I hope Aberama Gold is ok. He looked fine. Hopefully Finn and Michael grey disappear. The actors are fine, but the characters are so annoying! that would be some of the best moments of season 6 if that was the case.

Are the peaky blinders real? I watched a video on it and the answer was sort of. Also tommy quotes and edits, Tommy shelby, the real deal! The smoking 100 cigarettes a day real deal! let’s hope he staves off death like a certain alfie solomons! He crosses the line that bloke! too often! c'ero vicino
c'est quoi.
Do you want some ASMR, most of their voices are pretty much ASMR. a série
Peaky Blinders won a bunch of awards recently, should I get some awards for my impressions impersonations and all round voices? Maybe if I dressed up they’d give me the awards, behind the scenes and all that with cillian murphy and Tom hardy! Or maybe I’ll just wait until season 6 of peaky blinders is on DVD.

1 GUY, 20 VOICE IMPRESSIONS 2020
MORGAN FREEMAN
And so it came to pass that Andy Dufresne escaped from that Shawshank Prison escape room. I remember thinking it would take him 40 years to solve some really simple puzzles, turn out he did it in 52 minutes. 4 bored 13 years olds on a saturday just aren't meant to be caged.
GANDALF
Darkness took me, I strayed out of thought and time, stars wheeled overhead and every day felt as long as a life age of the earth. Old Toby finest Pipeweed in the south farthing, get it from a local Canadian dispenser now.
ARTHUR & TOMMY SHELBY
Tom I need a fucking cigarette, the f**k is this. Pomegranate Arthur, from now on the peaky blinders are going clean living, we're switching to a plant based diet, and I've booked us into a zumba class.
TYRION LANNISTER
Hello, and welcome to my masterclass, for the first time ever, you can learn the english accent with Tyrion Lannister. I will teach you quintessential English words, like Bastard, and Sean Bean. for only $90 we will cover dialects, ranging from scouse, that's boss la, through to Newcastle, alreet pet, haway, the lads.
THANOS
Going to bed hungry, scrounging for scraps, this planet is on the bring of collapse, that's why you should get a bamboo reclyclable toothbrush.
TOM HARDY
DARTH VADER
Hey Sithy's, I gotta say I love my Herbalife, this is what I looked like before two months of herbalife and this is after. I'm now a size 10 helmet and breathing apparatus. For 20% off use the discount code Vadershreds.
YODA
mmm, Maybe she's born with it, maybelline, maybe it is.
SEAN BEAN
More minutes, and unlimited data. Be More dog, it's the new simplicity package from 02, what no, no, keep it away from me. I want to live, my jugular.
SNAPE
Fancy your students mum loads? Search get into teaching. Always.
ATTENBOROUGH
Planet earth has 7 extraordinary continents, each one unique, each one, full of life, see it all with Turkish airlines, sponsored by bp.
BLACK PANTHER
Sister, what is this? a Vibranium vibrator.
LITTLEFINGER
A vote for me, is a vote for 50,000 extra nurses, a points based immigration system and a vote for get brexit done. A conservative party broadcast.
MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY
If you can make one pile of all your winnings, and risk it on one turn of pitch and toss, and lose, start again at your beginnings, never breath a word about your loss, bet in play now, Pogba to score next, 1000/1
LIAM NEESON
Black Horse, Misty field, uplifting music, drone shot, sad rain, neighing, the music swells, horses build to a trot, touching parent child moment, sunrise, galloping, Lloyds bank, by your side, what?
MORTY
Hello I'm a mac,
RICK
And I'm a PC
MORTY
I use my mac to look at pictures of jessica on instagram
RICK
And I'm not really a pc because Pc's are dumb, not a machine for smart people, I, I'm like linux, or I could be like linux if it weren't so simple that even a Jerry could use it to program a that AI language that outputs a fart that itself farts butts."

His standup is a character act about a retired maths teacher, his standup set includes impressions of Sir David Attenborough, Robin Williams, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Peaky Blinders, Tommy and Arthur Shelby and Gandalf from Lord of the Rings.

Always looking to update my roster I look to try out subscriber suggested impressions in the impressions challenge series before honing the best ones. Recently I have added Peaky Blinders and Marvel / Avengers characters to my arsenal!

I currently run a number of series including:
Impression Reels - The very best impressions I can do, Including LOTR, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Peaky Blinders, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Cartoons .etc
Impression Challenges - Trying out new impressions in a less polished form.
Impression Dramatic song covers - Voices of Reason.
Low Budget Animation - Stickman sketch remakes of Iconic Tv shows and movies.
How to do Impressions - An audience lead tutorial series where I attempt to pass on my Impressions knowledge.
Dubs - Comedic dubs of iconic scenes with new dialogue, (My Peaky Blinders and Lord of The Rings dubs have grossed over 6 million views on Facebook)
Standup - Clips from Standup sets I have performed over the last year.
Comedy Sketches - Comedy Sketches

I started learning impressions in 2012, at the age of 20. You can follow my full impressions journey in my new ‘How to do impressions’ tutorial series

After graduating from the University of Warwick in the summer 2013 he took 4 months out to concentrate on Youtube videos full time, including producing his most viewed video to date ‘Morgan Freeman and 40 other impressions’ with just over 12 million views. This foray into being a ‘full time Youtuber’ was cut short as he went travelling for 3 months before starting a 2 year teaching Graduate scheme with Charity ‘Teach First’.

While teaching he has performed in and narrated the 4 episode series ‘Lookalikes’ as Morgan Freeman. The show and the narration received a positive reception. The show aired on Channel 4 during the prime time slot of Friday 10pm for three weeks. It is now currently available on Netflix. Charlie also performed with other well known impressionists for an unaired pilot.

Charlie has worked for several prominent brands in relation to their products, including google and formula 1.

Since the summer of 2016 Charlie has once again dived into the world of YouTube, for the first time producing content on a weekly basis. He is also focusing on live performance; he has performed in live venues a total of 3 times to date.

His top impressions include:

Morgan Freeman (Red -Shawshank redemption)
Sir Ian McKellen (Gandalf – Lord of the Rings)
Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman – Breaking Bad)
Alan Rickman (Snape – Harry Potter)
Michael Caine (Alfred – Batman)

Unbelievable, as in you don't believe it deepfake of Cillian Murphy as Tommy Shelby...

Charlie Hopkinson is a comedic impressionist, impersonator, voice guy, whatever you want to call it who specialises in voices from current television shows and films. His standup is a character act about a retired maths teacher, his standup set includes impressions of Sir David Attenborough, Robin Williams, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Peaky Blinders, Tommy and Arthur Shelby and Gandalf from Lord of the Rings.

Always looking to update my roster I look to try out subscriber suggested impressions in the impressions challenge series before honing the best ones. Recently I have added Peaky Blinders and Marvel / Avengers characters to my arsenal!

I currently run a number of series including:
Impression Reels - The very best impressions I can do, Including LOTR, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Peaky Blinders, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Cartoons .etc
Impression Challenges - Trying out new impressions in a less polished form.
Impression Dramatic song covers - Voices of Reason.
Low Budget Animation - Stickman sketch remakes of Iconic Tv shows and movies.
How to do Impressions - An audience lead tutorial series where I attempt to pass on my Impressions knowledge.
Dubs - Comedic dubs of iconic scenes with new dialogue, (My Peaky Blinders and Lord of The Rings dubs have grossed over 6 million views on Facebook)
Standup - Clips from Standup sets I have performed over the last year.
Comedy Sketches - Comedy Sketches

I started learning impressions in 2012, at the age of 20. You can follow my full impressions journey in my new ‘How to do impressions’ tutorial series

After graduating from the University of Warwick in the summer 2013 he took 4 months out to concentrate on Youtube videos full time, including producing his most viewed video to date ‘Morgan Freeman and 40 other impressions’ with just over 12 million views. This foray into being a ‘full time Youtuber’ was cut short as he went travelling for 3 months before starting a 2 year teaching Graduate scheme with Charity ‘Teach First’.

While teaching he has performed in and narrated the 4 episode series ‘Lookalikes’ as Morgan Freeman. The show and the narration received a positive reception. The show aired on Channel 4 during the prime time slot of Friday 10pm for three weeks. It is now currently available on Netflix. Charlie also performed with other well known impressionists for an unaired pilot.

Charlie has worked for several prominent brands in relation to their products, including google and formula 1.

Since the summer of 2016 Charlie has once again dived into the world of YouTube, for the first time producing content on a weekly basis. He is also focusing on live performance; he has performed in live venues a total of 3 times to date.

His top impressions include:

Morgan Freeman (Red -Shawshank redemption)
Sir Ian McKellen (Gandalf – Lord of the Rings)
Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman – Breaking Bad)
Alan Rickman (Snape – Harry Potter)
Michael Caine (Alfred – Batman)
Jon Snow (Game of Thrones)

Anyone looking forward to Season 6? I quite enjoyed peaky blinders season 5, is peaky blinders season 5 on Netflix yet? If anyone knows of a season 6 trailer let me know! Has the cast started filming for season 6 yet? How will Tommy react to Oswald Mosley plan going tits up? bit of a blooper! Red right hand by nick cave, what a song! what a soundtrack! huzzah! maybe I should cover it, oh wait I already did!

As you guys know I’m a big fan of Peaky Blinders, the cast, haircuts, whiskey, hair, outfits, hats, you name it, I like it. Thats why I do all the peaky blinder cast impressions (even the women!, Ada and Polly!), birmingham accent and all (or not in some cases). 

Will Tom Hardy come back as Alfie Solomons in the new season, season 6? no spoilers, and no fighting! I hope Aberama Gold is ok. He looked fine. Hopefully Finn and Michael grey disappear. The actors are fine, but the characters are so annoying! that would be some of the best moments of season 6 if that was the case.

Are the peaky blinders real? I watched a video on it and the answer was sort of. and tommy quotes and edits, Tommy shelby, the real deal! The smoking 100 cigarettes a day real deal! let’s hope he staves off death like a certain alfie solomons! He crosses the line that bloke! too often! c'ero vicino
c'est quoi.
Do you want some ASMR, most of their voices are pretty much ASMR. a série
Peaky Blinders won a bunch of awards recently, should I get some awards for my impressions impersonations and all round voices? Maybe if I dressed up they’d give me the awards, behind the scenes and all that with cillian murphy and Tom hardy! Or maybe I’ll just wait until season 6 of peaky blinders is on DVD.

I started learning impressions in 2012, at the age of 20. You can follow my full impressions journey in my new ‘How to do impressions’ tutorial series

After graduating from the University of Warwick in the summer 2013 he took 4 months out to concentrate on Youtube videos full time, including producing his most viewed video to date ‘Morgan Freeman and 40 other impressions’ with just over 12 million views. This foray into being a ‘full time Youtuber’ was cut short as he went travelling for 3 months before starting a 2 year teaching Graduate scheme with Charity ‘Teach First’.

While teaching he has performed in and narrated the 4 episode series ‘Lookalikes’ as Morgan Freeman. The show and the narration received a positive reception. The show aired on Channel 4 during the prime time slot of Friday 10pm for three weeks. It is now currently available on Netflix. Charlie also performed with other well known impressionists for an unaired pilot.

Charlie has worked for several prominent brands in relation to their products, including google and formula 1.

Since the summer of 2016 Charlie has once again dived into the world of YouTube, for the first time producing content on a weekly basis. He is also focusing on live performance; he has performed in live venues a total of 3 times to date.

His top impressions include:

Morgan Freeman (Red -Shawshank redemption)
Sir Ian McKellen (Gandalf – Lord of the Rings)
Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman – Breaking Bad)
Alan Rickman (Snape – Harry Potter)
Michael Caine (Alfred – Batman)

Want to learn how to do the gandalf voice? well this is the impression how to do tutorial for you and other lotr fanatics. Whether you want to be a shakespearean actor, an impressionist or a hobbit wizard, In this video I show you how to do the Gandalf voice impression. Use those eyes!



Rough transcript:
CHARLIE
This is Gandalf, ancient wizard and guy of middle earth. You have requested a tutorial on the Gandalf impression, is the impression any good?
GANDALF
Darkness took me, and I strayed out of thought and time, stars wheeled overhead and every day felt like a life age of the earth, that’s roughly how long it took to learn this Gandalf impression

BASICS
Ian Mckellen is a shakespearean actor, so he has the posh rp english accent. Imagine the two poshest english people you know, add them together, then take 80% off. That's right 120% posh english
He has a deep raspy voice, so you want to produce it from the back of the throat. The resources I use are the scene from Moria, so do all who live to see such times. and farewell my brave hobbits.
TIP 1: ADDITIONAL NOISES
When you can do an impression really well, people can tell who it is with just a noise, without saying anything, check out ross marquand's micro impressions for a good example of this, here's some noises you should practice and add to your repertoire for gandalf. 'Suprised - This tea is too hot, Suspicious grumble - mmmm, Pippin's done something wrong, huh!, 

TIP 2: STEAL RHYTHYMS
Once you go past the 'quotes stage of the impression' you will have a bank of quotes that you should know inside out, what I do is steal the rhythm and tone of these quotes and apply them to a new phrase, for example If i take the phrase that i always use for jesse pink man in breaking bad: 'Yo Mr White, like seriously, what's you problem man are you for real and that is an encouraging thought'. Note how I can steal the body language, and the rhythm of this quote 'Yo Mr White, like seriously, what's you problem man are you for real and that is an encouraging thought'.This means if you build up a bank of quotes and mentally separate them into modes. gandalf: softly spoken. disgruntled, annoyed. How well you are able to do this does depend on how well you've done your prepwork, how much you have watched and listened to the character.
TIP 3: ACT FROM THE EYES
(Clip from reservoir) My automatic trigger for Gandalf is to stoop my shoulders, and pull my face into position using these muscles around my eyes.If you study Ian Mcekellen's portrayal of Gandalf I always notice how these muscles contract. So much of his expression comes from the muscles around the eyes. They have a big impact on the voice. So I use the eyes as a physical trigger. It helps pull your instrument into place the mouth into shape. If you watch my impression videos, you will notice my most accurate vocal portrayal of gandalf during those softly spoken closeup monologues. Because I can cover all the physical triggers ian mckellen performs. When Ian required to be more conversational or even shouting. I don't get to use these observations so the impression suffers a bit. 
LEARNING FRAME
Finally I will give you a learning frame to repeat alongside as you start or try to improve your gandalf impression:

Farewell, my brave hobbits, my work is now finished, here at last, on the shores of the sea, comes the end of our fellowship, I will not say do not weep, for not all tears are an evil..."

Charlie Hopkinson is a comedic impressionist, impersonator, voice guy, whatever you want to call it who specialises in voices from current television shows and films. His standup is a character act about a retired maths teacher, his standup set includes impressions of Sir David Attenborough, Robin Williams, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Peaky Blinders, Tommy and Arthur Shelby and Gandalf from Lord of the Rings.

Always looking to update my roster I look to try out subscriber suggested impressions in the impressions challenge series before honing the best ones. Recently I have added Peaky Blinders and Marvel / Avengers characters to my arsenal!

I currently run a number of series including:
Impression Reels - The very best impressions I can do, Including LOTR, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Peaky Blinders, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Cartoons .etc
Impression Challenges - Trying out new impressions in a less polished form.
Impression Dramatic song covers - Voices of Reason.
Low Budget Animation - Stickman sketch remakes of Iconic Tv shows and movies.
How to do Impressions - An audience lead tutorial series where I attempt to pass on my Impressions knowledge.
Dubs - Comedic dubs of iconic scenes with new dialogue, (My Peaky Blinders and Lord of The Rings dubs have grossed over 6 million views on Facebook)
Standup - Clips from Standup sets I have performed over the last year.
Comedy Sketches - Comedy Sketches

I started learning impressions in 2012, at the age of 20. You can follow my full impressions journey in my new ‘How to do impressions’ tutorial series

After graduating from the University of Warwick in the summer 2013 he took 4 months out to concentrate on Youtube videos full time, including producing his most viewed video to date ‘Morgan Freeman and 40 other impressions’ with just over 12 million views. This foray into being a ‘full time Youtuber’ was cut short as he went travelling for 3 months before starting a 2 year teaching Graduate scheme with Charity ‘Teach First’.

While teaching he has performed in and narrated the 4 episode series ‘Lookalikes’ as Morgan Freeman. The show and the narration received a positive reception. The show aired on Channel 4 during the prime time slot of Friday 10pm for three weeks. It is now currently available on Netflix. Charlie also performed with other well known impressionists for an unaired pilot.

Charlie has worked for several prominent brands in relation to their products, including google and formula 1.

Since the summer of 2016 Charlie has once again dived into the world of YouTube, for the first time producing content on a weekly basis. He is also focusing on live performance; he has performed in live venues a total of 3 times to date.

His top impressions include:

Morgan Freeman (Red -Shawshank redemption)
Sir Ian McKellen (Gandalf – Lord of the Rings)
Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman – Breaking Bad)

Rough transcript:
1 GUY, 20 VOICE IMPRESSIONS 2020
MORGAN FREEMAN
And so it came to pass that Andy Dufresne escaped from that Shawshank Prison escape room. I remember thinking it would take him 40 years to solve some really simple puzzles, turn out he did it in 52 minutes. 4 bored 13 years olds on a saturday just aren't meant to be caged.
GANDALF
Darkness took me, I strayed out of thought and time, stars wheeled overhead and every day felt as long as a life age of the earth. Old Toby finest Pipeweed in the south farthing, get it from a local Canadian dispenser now.
ARTHUR & TOMMY SHELBY
Tom I need a fucking cigarette, the f**k is this. Pomegranate Arthur, from now on the peaky blinders are going clean living, we're switching to a plant based diet, and I've booked us into a zumba class.
TYRION LANNISTER
Hello, and welcome to my masterclass, for the first time ever, you can learn the english accent with Tyrion Lannister. I will teach you quintessential English words, like Bastard, and Sean Bean. for only $90 we will cover dialects, ranging from scouse, that's boss la, through to Newcastle, alreet pet, haway, the lads.
THANOS
Going to bed hungry, scrounging for scraps, this planet is on the bring of collapse, that's why you should get a bamboo reclyclable toothbrush.
TOM HARDY
DARTH VADER
Hey Sithy's, I gotta say I love my Herbalife, this is what I looked like before two months of herbalife and this is after. I'm now a size 10 helmet and breathing apparatus. For 20% off use the discount code Vadershreds.
YODA
mmm, Maybe she's born with it, maybelline, maybe it is.
SEAN BEAN
More minutes, and unlimited data. Be More dog, it's the new simplicity package from 02, what no, no, keep it away from me. I want to live, my jugular.
SNAPE
Fancy your students mum loads? Search get into teaching. Always.
ATTENBOROUGH
Planet earth has 7 extraordinary continents, each one unique, each one, full of life, see it all with Turkish airlines, sponsored by bp.
BLACK PANTHER
Sister, what is this? a Vibranium vibrator.
LITTLEFINGER
A vote for me, is a vote for 50,000 extra nurses, a points based immigration system and a vote for get brexit done. A conservative party broadcast.
MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY
If you can make one pile of all your winnings, and risk it on one turn of pitch and toss, and lose, start again at your beginnings, never breath a word about your loss, bet in play now, Pogba to score next, 1000/1
LIAM NEESON
Black Horse, Misty field, uplifting music, drone shot, sad rain, neighing, the music swells, horses build to a trot, touching parent child moment, sunrise, galloping, Lloyds bank, by your side, what?
MORTY
Hello I'm a mac,
RICK
And I'm a PC
MORTY
I use my mac to look at pictures of jessica on instagram
RICK
And I'm not really a pc because Pc's are dumb, not a machine for smart people, I, I'm like linux, or I could be like linux if it weren't so simple that even a Jerry could use it to program a that AI language that outputs a fart that itself farts butts."

His standup is a character act about a retired maths teacher, his standup set includes impressions of Sir David Attenborough, Robin Williams, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Peaky Blinders, Tommy and Arthur Shelby and Gandalf from Lord of the Rings.

Always looking to update my roster I look to try out subscriber suggested impressions in the impressions challenge series before honing the best ones. Recently I have added Peaky Blinders and Marvel / Avengers characters to my arsenal!

I currently run a number of series including:
Impression Reels - The very best impressions I can do, Including LOTR, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Peaky Blinders, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Cartoons .etc
Impression Challenges - Trying out new impressions in a less polished form.
Impression Dramatic song covers - Voices of Reason.

I started learning impressions in 2012, at the age of 20. You can follow my full impressions journey in my new ‘How to do impressions’ tutorial series

After graduating from the University of Warwick in the summer 2013 he took 4 months out to concentrate on Youtube videos full time, including producing his most viewed video to date ‘Morgan Freeman and 40 other impressions’ with just over 12 million views. This foray into being a ‘full time Youtuber’ was cut short as he went travelling for 3 months before starting a 2 year teaching Graduate scheme with Charity ‘Teach First’.

While teaching he has performed in and narrated the 4 episode series ‘Lookalikes’ as Morgan Freeman. The show and the narration received a positive reception. The show aired on Channel 4 during the prime time slot of Friday 10pm for three weeks. It is now currently available on Netflix. Charlie also performed with other well known impressionists for an unaired pilot.

Charlie has worked for several prominent brands in relation to their products, including google and formula 1.

Since the summer of 2016 Charlie has once again dived into the world of YouTube, for the first time producing content on a weekly basis. He is also focusing on live performance; he has performed in live venues a total of 3 times to date.

Charlie Hopkinson is a comedic impressionist, impersonator, voice guy, whatever you want to call it who specialises in voices from current television shows and films. His standup is a character act about a retired maths teacher, his standup set includes impressions of Sir David Attenborough, Robin Williams, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Peaky Blinders, Tommy and Arthur Shelby and Gandalf from Lord of the Rings.

Always looking to update my roster I look to try out subscriber suggested impressions in the impressions challenge series before honing the best ones. Recently I have added Peaky Blinders and Marvel / Avengers characters to my arsenal!

I currently run a number of series including:
Impression Reels - The very best impressions I can do, Including LOTR, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Peaky Blinders, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Cartoons .etc
Impression Challenges - Trying out new impressions in a less polished form.
Impression Dramatic song covers - Voices of Reason.
Low Budget Animation - Stickman sketch remakes of Iconic Tv shows and movies.
How to do Impressions - An audience lead tutorial series where I attempt to pass on my Impressions knowledge.
Dubs - Comedic dubs of iconic scenes with new dialogue, (My Peaky Blinders and Lord of The Rings dubs have grossed over 6 million views on Facebook)
Standup - Clips from Standup sets I have performed over the last year.
Comedy Sketches - Comedy Sketches

I started learning impressions in 2012, at the age of 20. You can follow my full impressions journey in my new ‘How to do impressions’ tutorial series

After graduating from the University of Warwick in the summer 2013 he took 4 months out to concentrate on Youtube videos full time, including producing his most viewed video to date ‘Morgan Freeman and 40 other impressions’ with just over 12 million views. This foray into being a ‘full time Youtuber’ was cut short as he went travelling for 3 months before starting a 2 year teaching Graduate scheme with Charity ‘Teach First’.

While teaching he has performed in and narrated the 4 episode series ‘Lookalikes’ as Morgan Freeman. The show and the narration received a positive reception. The show aired on Channel 4 during the prime time slot of Friday 10pm for three weeks. It is now currently available on Netflix. Charlie also performed with other well known impressionists for an unaired pilot.

Charlie has worked for several prominent brands in relation to their products, including google and formula 1.

Since the summer of 2016 Charlie has once again dived into the world of YouTube, for the first time producing content on a weekly basis. He is also focusing on live performance; he has performed in live venues a total of 3 times to date.

His top impressions include:

Morgan Freeman (Red -Shawshank redemption)
Sir Ian McKellen (Gandalf – Lord of the Rings)
Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman – Breaking Bad)
Alan Rickman (Snape – Harry Potter)
Michael Caine (Alfred – Batman)

Hurt (Peaky Blinders) Rough transcript

Tommy: So fucking close, ahh when there’s a woman, I nearly had fucking everything. Already broken.

Arthur Shelby: I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
John Shelby: The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everyfin
Alfie Solomons: What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
Tommy Shelby: And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
Inspector Campbell: I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liars chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Aberama Gold: Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
Polly Gray: What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end, Tommy
Luca Changretta: And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
Tommy Shelby: If I could start again
A million miles away
I will keep myself
I would find a way"

Lay down
Your sweet and weary head
The night is falling
You have come to journey's end
Sleep now
And dream of the ones who came before
They are calling
From across the distant shore
Why do you weep?
What are these tears upon your face?
Soon you will see
All of your fears will pass away
Safe in my arms
You're only sleeping
What can you see
On the horizon?
Why do the white gulls call?
Across the sea
A pale moon rises
The ships have come to carry you home
And all will turn
To silver glass
A light on the water
All Souls pass
Hope fades
Into the world of night
Through shadows falling
Out of memory and time
Don't say
We have come now to the end
White shores are calling
You and I will meet again
And you'll be here in my arms
Just sleeping
And all will turn
To silver glass
A light on the water

Charlie Hopkinson is a comedic impressionist, impersonator, voice guy, whatever you want to call it who specialises in voices from current television shows and films. His standup is a character act about a retired maths teacher, his standup set includes impressions of Sir David Attenborough, Robin Williams, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Peaky Blinders, Tommy and Arthur Shelby and Gandalf from Lord of the Rings.

Always looking to update my roster I look to try out subscriber suggested impressions in the impressions challenge series before honing the best ones. Recently I have added Peaky Blinders and Marvel / Avengers characters to my arsenal!

I currently run a number of series including:
Impression Reels - The very best impressions I can do, Including LOTR, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Peaky Blinders, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Cartoons .etc
Impression Challenges - Trying out new impressions in a less polished form.
Impression Dramatic song covers - Voices of Reason.
Low Budget Animation - Stickman sketch remakes of Iconic Tv shows and movies.
How to do Impressions - An audience lead tutorial series where I attempt to pass on my Impressions knowledge.
Dubs - Comedic dubs of iconic scenes with new dialogue, (My Peaky Blinders and Lord of The Rings dubs have grossed over 6 million views on Facebook)
Standup - Clips from Standup sets I have performed over the last year.
Comedy Sketches - Comedy Sketches

I started learning impressions in 2012, at the age of 20. You can follow my full impressions journey in my new ‘How to do impressions’ tutorial series

After graduating from the University of Warwick in the summer 2013 he took 4 months out to concentrate on Youtube videos full time, including producing his most viewed video to date ‘Morgan Freeman and 40 other impressions’ with just over 12 million views. This foray into being a ‘full time Youtuber’ was cut short as he went travelling for 3 months before starting a 2 year teaching Graduate scheme with Charity ‘Teach First’.

While teaching he has performed in and narrated the 4 episode series ‘Lookalikes’ as Morgan Freeman. The show and the narration received a positive reception. The show aired on Channel 4 during the prime time slot of Friday 10pm for three weeks. It is now currently available on Netflix. Charlie also performed with other well known impressionists for an unaired pilot.

Charlie has worked for several prominent brands in relation to their products, including google and formula 1.

Since the summer of 2016 Charlie has once again dived into the world of YouTube, for the first time producing content on a weekly basis. He is also focusing on live performance; he has performed in live venues a total of 3 times to date.

His top impressions include:

Morgan Freeman (Red -Shawshank redemption)

Charlie Hopkinson is a comedic impressionist, impersonator, voice guy, whatever you want to call it who specialises in voices from current television shows and films. His standup is a character act about a retired maths teacher, his standup set includes impressions of Sir David Attenborough, Robin Williams, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Peaky Blinders, Tommy and Arthur Shelby and Gandalf from Lord of the Rings.

I currently run a number of series including:
Impression Reels - The very best impressions I can do, Including LOTR, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Peaky Blinders, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Cartoons .etc
Impression Challenges - Trying out new impressions in a less polished form.
Impression Dramatic song covers - Voices of Reason.
