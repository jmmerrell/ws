Well done Gareth Southgate.\nLearn Impressions: https://skl.sh/3dmmGr6\n\nKnow when I'm performing: http://bit.ly/2ZawJ8G\nBuy a Voiceover: http://bit.ly/2QOBcLz\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/charlie.hopkinson4/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Voiceraptor\nSnapchat: chopkinson92\nWebsite: https://www.charlie-hopkinson.com/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/c_hopkinson\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=3213723\nMerchandise: shop.spreadshirt.co.uk/CharlieHopkinson\n\nCharlie Hopkinson is a comedic impressionist, impersonator, voice guy, whatever you want to call it who specialises in voices from current television shows and films. His standup is a character act about a retired maths teacher, his standup set includes impressions of Sir David Attenborough, Robin Williams, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Peaky Blinders, Tommy and Arthur Shelby and Gandalf from Lord of the Rings.\n\nAlways looking to update my roster I look to try out subscriber suggested impressions in the impressions challenge series before honing the best ones. Recently I have added Peaky Blinders and Marvel / Avengers characters to my arsenal!\n\nI currently run a number of series including:\nImpression Reels - The very best impressions I can do, Including LOTR, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Peaky Blinders, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Cartoons .etc\nImpression Challenges - Trying out new impressions in a less polished form.\nImpression Dramatic song covers - Voices of Reason.\nLow Budget Animation - Stickman sketch remakes of Iconic Tv shows and movies.\nHow to do Impressions - An audience lead tutorial series where I attempt to pass on my Impressions knowledge.\nDubs - Comedic dubs of iconic scenes with new dialogue, (My Peaky Blinders and Lord of The Rings dubs have grossed over 6 million views on Facebook)\nStandup - Clips from Standup sets I have performed over the last year.\nComedy Sketches - Comedy Sketches\n\nI started learning impressions in 2012, at the age of 20. You can follow my full impressions journey in my new \u2018How to do impressions\u2019 tutorial series\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Warwick in the summer 2013 he took 4 months out to concentrate on Youtube videos full time, including producing his most viewed video to date \u2018Morgan Freeman and 40 other impressions\u2019 with just over 12 million views. This foray into being a \u2018full time Youtuber\u2019 was cut short as he went travelling for 3 months before starting a 2 year teaching Graduate scheme with Charity \u2018Teach First\u2019.\n\nWhile teaching he has performed in and narrated the 4 episode series \u2018Lookalikes\u2019 as Morgan Freeman. The show and the narration received a positive reception. The show aired on Channel 4 during the prime time slot of Friday 10pm for three weeks. It is now currently available on Netflix. Charlie also performed with other well known impressionists for an unaired pilot.\n\nCharlie has worked for several prominent brands in relation to their products, including google and formula 1.\n\nSince the summer of 2016 Charlie has once again dived into the world of YouTube, for the first time producing content on a weekly basis. He is also focusing on live performance; he has performed in live venues a total of 3 times to date.\n\nHis top impressions include:\n\nMorgan Freeman (Red -Shawshank redemption)\nSir Ian McKellen (Gandalf \u2013 Lord of the Rings)\nAaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman \u2013 Breaking Bad)\nAlan Rickman (Snape \u2013 Harry Potter)\nMichael Caine (Alfred \u2013 Batman)\nJon Snow (Game of Thrones)\nJack Sparrow (Pirates of the Carribean)\nChristoph Waltz (Django Unchained, Inglorious bastards)\nAlec Guiness (Ben Kenobi \u2013 Star Wars)\nAgent Smith (The Matrix)\nSean Bean (Boromir \u2013 Lord of the Rings)\nRichard Armitage (Thorin Oakenshield \u2013 The Hobbit)\nCharles Dance (Tywin Lannister \u2013 Game of Thrones)\nTyrion Lannister (Game of Thrones)\nBryan Cranston (Walter White \u2013 Breaking Bad)\nFrank Underwood (House of Cards)\nTommy Shelby (Peaky Blinders)",

His standup is a character act about a retired maths teacher, his standup set includes impressions of Sir David Attenborough, Robin Williams, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Peaky Blinders, Tommy and Arthur Shelby and Gandalf from Lord of the Rings.\n\nAlways looking to update my roster I look to try out subscriber suggested impressions in the impressions challenge series before honing the best ones. Recently I have added Peaky Blinders and Marvel / Avengers characters to my arsenal!\n\nI currently run a number of series including:\nImpression Reels - The very best impressions I can do, Including LOTR, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Peaky Blinders, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Cartoons .etc\nImpression Challenges - Trying out new impressions in a less polished form.\nImpression Dramatic song covers - Voices of Reason.\nLow Budget Animation - Stickman sketch remakes of Iconic Tv shows and movies.\nHow to do Impressions - An audience lead tutorial series where I attempt to pass on my Impressions knowledge.\nDubs - Comedic dubs of iconic scenes with new dialogue, (My Peaky Blinders and Lord of The Rings dubs have grossed over 6 million views on Facebook)\nStandup - Clips from Standup sets I have performed over the last year.\nComedy Sketches - Comedy Sketches\n\nI started learning impressions in 2012, at the age of 20. You can follow my full impressions journey in my new \u2018How to do impressions\u2019 tutorial series\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Warwick in the summer 2013 he took 4 months out to concentrate on Youtube videos full time, including producing his most viewed video to date \u2018Morgan Freeman and 40 other impressions\u2019 with just over 12 million views. This foray into being a \u2018full time Youtuber\u2019 was cut short as he went travelling for 3 months before starting a 2 year teaching Graduate scheme with Charity \u2018Teach First\u2019.\n\nWhile teaching he has performed in and narrated the 4 episode series \u2018Lookalikes\u2019 as Morgan Freeman. The show and the narration received a positive reception. The show aired on Channel 4 during the prime time slot of Friday 10pm for three weeks. It is now currently available on Netflix. Charlie also performed with other well known impressionists for an unaired pilot.\n\nCharlie has worked for several prominent brands in relation to their products, including google and formula 1.\n\nSince the summer of 2016 Charlie has once again dived into the world of YouTube, for the first time producing content on a weekly basis. He is also focusing on live performance; he has performed in live venues a total of 3 times to date.\n\nHis top impressions include:\n\nMorgan Freeman (Red -Shawshank redemption)\nSir Ian McKellen (Gandalf \u2013 Lord of the Rings)\nAaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman \u2013 Breaking Bad)\nAlan Rickman (Snape \u2013 Harry Potter)\nMichael Caine (Alfred \u2013 Batman)\nJon Snow (Game of Thrones)\nJack Sparrow (Pirates of the Carribean)\nChristoph Waltz (Django Unchained, Inglorious bastards)\nAlec Guiness (Ben Kenobi \u2013 Star Wars)\nAgent Smith (The Matrix)\nSean Bean (Boromir \u2013 Lord of the Rings)\nRichard Armitage (Thorin Oakenshield \u2013 The Hobbit)\nCharles Dance (Tywin Lannister \u2013 Game of Thrones)\nTyrion Lannister (Game of Thrones)\nBryan Cranston (Walter White \u2013 Breaking Bad)\nFrank Underwood (House of Cards)\nTommy Shelby (Peaky Blinders)",

I quite enjoyed peaky blinders season 5, is peaky blinders season 5 on Netflix yet? If anyone knows of a season 6 trailer let me know! Has the cast started filming for season 6 yet?

Thats why I do all the peaky blinder cast impressions (even the women!, Ada and Polly!), birmingham accent and all (or not in some cases). \n\nWill Tom Hardy come back as Alfie Solomons in the new season, season 6? no spoilers, and no fighting! I hope Aberama Gold is ok. He looked fine. Hopefully Finn and Michael grey disappear. The actors are fine, but the characters are so annoying! that would be some of the best moments of season 6 if that was the case.\n\nAre the peaky blinders real? I watched a video on it and the answer was sort of. Also tommy quotes and edits, Tommy shelby, the real deal! The smoking 100 cigarettes a day real deal! let\u2019s hope he staves off death like a certain alfie solomons! He crosses the line that bloke! too often! c'ero vicino\nc'est quoi.\nDo you want some ASMR, most of their voices are pretty much ASMR. a s\u00e9rie\nPeaky Blinders won a bunch of awards recently, should I get some awards for my impressions impersonations and all round voices? Maybe if I dressed up they\u2019d give me the awards, behind the scenes and all that with cillian murphy and Tom hardy! Or maybe I\u2019ll just wait until season 6 of peaky blinders is on DVD.\n\nCharlie Hopkinson is a comedic impressionist, impersonator, voice guy, whatever you want to call it who specialises in voices from current television shows and films.

This foray into being a \u2018full time Youtuber\u2019 was cut short as he went travelling for 3 months before starting a 2 year teaching Graduate scheme with Charity \u2018Teach First\u2019.\n\nWhile teaching he has performed in and narrated the 4 episode series \u2018Lookalikes\u2019 as Morgan Freeman.

His standup is a character act about a retired maths teacher, his standup set includes impressions of Sir David Attenborough, Robin Williams, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Peaky Blinders, Tommy and Arthur Shelby and Gandalf from Lord of the Rings.\n\nAlways looking to update my roster I look to try out subscriber suggested impressions in the impressions challenge series before honing the best ones. Recently I have added Peaky Blinders and Marvel / Avengers characters to my arsenal!\n\nI currently run a number of series including:\nImpression Reels - The very best impressions I can do, Including LOTR, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Peaky Blinders, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Cartoons .etc\nImpression Challenges - Trying out new impressions in a less polished form.\nImpression Dramatic song covers - Voices of Reason.\nLow Budget Animation - Stickman sketch remakes of Iconic Tv shows and movies.\nHow to do Impressions - An audience lead tutorial series where I attempt to pass on my Impressions knowledge.\nDubs - Comedic dubs of iconic scenes with new dialogue, (My Peaky Blinders and Lord of The Rings dubs have grossed over 6 million views on Facebook)\nStandup - Clips from Standup sets I have performed over the last year.\nComedy Sketches - Comedy Sketches\n\nI started learning impressions in 2012, at the age of 20. You can follow my full impressions journey in my new \u2018How to do impressions\u2019 tutorial series\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Warwick in the summer 2013 he took 4 months out to concentrate on Youtube videos full time, including producing his most viewed video to date \u2018Morgan Freeman and 40 other impressions\u2019 with just over 12 million views. This foray into being a \u2018full time Youtuber\u2019 was cut short as he went travelling for 3 months before starting a 2 year teaching Graduate scheme with Charity \u2018Teach First\u2019.\n\nWhile teaching he has performed in and narrated the 4 episode series \u2018Lookalikes\u2019 as Morgan Freeman. The show and the narration received a positive reception. The show aired on Channel 4 during the prime time slot of Friday 10pm for three weeks. It is now currently available on Netflix. Charlie also performed with other well known impressionists for an unaired pilot.\n\nCharlie has worked for several prominent brands in relation to their products, including google and formula 1.\n\nSince the summer of 2016 Charlie has once again dived into the world of YouTube, for the first time producing content on a weekly basis. He is also focusing on live performance; he has performed in live venues a total of 3 times to date.\n\nHis top impressions include:\n\nMorgan Freeman (Red -Shawshank redemption)\nSir Ian McKellen (Gandalf \u2013 Lord of the Rings)\nAaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman \u2013 Breaking Bad)\nAlan Rickman (Snape \u2013 Harry Potter)\nMichael Caine (Alfred \u2013 Batman)\nJon Snow (Game of Thrones)\nJack Sparrow (Pirates of the Carribean)\nChristoph Waltz (Django Unchained, Inglorious bastards)\nAlec Guiness (Ben Kenobi \u2013 Star Wars)\nAgent Smith (The Matrix)\nSean Bean (Boromir \u2013 Lord of the Rings)\nRichard Armitage (Thorin Oakenshield \u2013 The Hobbit)\nCharles Dance (Tywin Lannister \u2013 Game of Thrones)\nTyrion Lannister (Game of Thrones)\nBryan Cranston (Walter White \u2013 Breaking Bad)\nFrank Underwood (House of Cards)\nTommy Shelby (Peaky Blinders)"

Polly grey, Ada Shelby, Esme and Grace.\n\nAnyone looking forward to Season 6? I quite enjoyed peaky blinders season 5, is peaky blinders season 5 on Netflix yet? If anyone knows of a season 6 trailer let me know! Has the cast started filming for season 6 yet? How will Tommy react to Oswald Mosley plan going tits up? bit of a blooper! Red right hand by nick cave, what a song! what a soundtrack! huzzah! maybe I should cover it, oh wait I already did!\n\nAs you guys know I\u2019m a big fan of Peaky Blinders, the cast, haircuts, whiskey, hair, outfits, hats, you name it, I like it. Thats why I do all the peaky blinder cast impressions (even the women!, Ada and Polly!), birmingham accent and all (or not in some cases). \n\nWill Tom Hardy come back as Alfie Solomons in the new season, season 6? no spoilers, and no fighting! I hope Aberama Gold is ok. He looked fine. Hopefully Finn and Michael grey disappear. The actors are fine, but the characters are so annoying! that would be some of the best moments of season 6 if that was the case.\n\nAre the peaky blinders real? I watched a video on it and the answer was sort of. Also tommy quotes and edits, Tommy shelby, the real deal! The smoking 100 cigarettes a day real deal! let\u2019s hope he staves off death like a certain alfie solomons! He crosses the line that bloke! too often! c'ero vicino\nc'est quoi.\nDo you want some ASMR, most of their voices are pretty much ASMR. a s\u00e9rie\nPeaky Blinders won a bunch of awards recently, should I get some awards for my impressions impersonations and all round voices? Maybe if I dressed up they\u2019d give me the awards, behind the scenes and all that with cillian murphy and Tom hardy! Or maybe I\u2019ll just wait until season 6 of peaky blinders is on DVD.\n\nCharlie Hopkinson is a comedic impressionist, impersonator, voice guy, whatever you want to call it who specialises in voices from current television shows and films.

Whether you want to be a shakespearean actor, an impressionist or a hobbit wizard, In this video I show you how to do the Gandalf voice impression. Use those eyes!\n\n\n\nRough transcript:\nCHARLIE\nThis is Gandalf, ancient wizard and guy of middle earth. You have requested a tutorial on the Gandalf impression, is the impression any good?\nGANDALF\nDarkness took me, and I strayed out of thought and time, stars wheeled overhead and every day felt like a life age of the earth, that\u2019s roughly how long it took to learn this Gandalf impression\n\nBASICS\nIan Mckellen is a shakespearean actor, so he has the posh rp english accent. Imagine the two poshest english people you know, add them together, then take 80% off. That's right 120% posh english\nHe has a deep raspy voice, so you want to produce it from the back of the throat. The resources I use are the scene from Moria, so do all who live to see such times. and farewell my brave hobbits.\nTIP 1: ADDITIONAL NOISES\nWhen you can do an impression really well, people can tell who it is with just a noise, without saying anything, check out ross marquand's micro impressions for a good example of this, here's some noises you should practice and add to your repertoire for gandalf. 'Suprised - This tea is too hot, Suspicious grumble - mmmm, Pippin's done something wrong, huh!, \n\nTIP 2: STEAL RHYTHYMS\nOnce you go past the 'quotes stage of the impression' you will have a bank of quotes that you should know inside out, what I do is steal the rhythm and tone of these quotes and apply them to a new phrase, for example If i take the phrase that i always use for jesse pink man in breaking bad: 'Yo Mr White, like seriously, what's you problem man are you for real and that is an encouraging thought'. Note how I can steal the body language, and the rhythm of this quote 'Yo Mr White, like seriously, what's you problem man are you for real and that is an encouraging thought'.This means if you build up a bank of quotes and mentally separate them into modes. gandalf: softly spoken. disgruntled, annoyed. How well you are able to do this does depend on how well you've done your prepwork, how much you have watched and listened to the character.\nTIP 3: ACT FROM THE EYES\n(Clip from reservoir) My automatic trigger for Gandalf is to stoop my shoulders, and pull my face into position using these muscles around my eyes.If you study Ian Mcekellen's portrayal of Gandalf I always notice how these muscles contract. So much of his expression comes from the muscles around the eyes. They have a big impact on the voice. So I use the eyes as a physical trigger. It helps pull your instrument into place the mouth into shape. If you watch my impression videos, you will notice my most accurate vocal portrayal of gandalf during those softly spoken closeup monologues. Because I can cover all the physical triggers ian mckellen performs. When Ian required to be more conversational or even shouting. I don't get to use these observations so the impression suffers a bit. \nLEARNING FRAME\nFinally I will give you a learning frame to repeat alongside as you start or try to improve your gandalf impression:\n\nFarewell, my brave hobbits, my work is now finished, here at last, on the shores of the sea, comes the end of our fellowship, I will not say do not weep, for not all tears are an evil...",

Whether you want to be a shakespearean actor, an impressionist or a hobbit wizard, In this video I show you how to do the Gandalf voice impression. Use those eyes!\n\n\n\nRough transcript:\nCHARLIE\nThis is Gandalf, ancient wizard and guy of middle earth. You have requested a tutorial on the Gandalf impression, is the impression any good?\nGANDALF\nDarkness took me, and I strayed out of thought and time, stars wheeled overhead and every day felt like a life age of the earth, that\u2019s roughly how long it took to learn this Gandalf impression\n\nBASICS\nIan Mckellen is a shakespearean actor, so he has the posh rp english accent. Imagine the two poshest english people you know, add them together, then take 80% off. That's right 120% posh english\nHe has a deep raspy voice, so you want to produce it from the back of the throat. The resources I use are the scene from Moria, so do all who live to see such times. and farewell my brave hobbits.\nTIP 1: ADDITIONAL NOISES\nWhen you can do an impression really well, people can tell who it is with just a noise, without saying anything, check out ross marquand's micro impressions for a good example of this, here's some noises you should practice and add to your repertoire for gandalf. 'Suprised - This tea is too hot, Suspicious grumble - mmmm, Pippin's done something wrong, huh!, \n\nTIP 2: STEAL RHYTHYMS\nOnce you go past the 'quotes stage of the impression' you will have a bank of quotes that you should know inside out, what I do is steal the rhythm and tone of these quotes and apply them to a new phrase, for example If i take the phrase that i always use for jesse pink man in breaking bad: 'Yo Mr White, like seriously, what's you problem man are you for real and that is an encouraging thought'. Note how I can steal the body language, and the rhythm of this quote 'Yo Mr White, like seriously, what's you problem man are you for real and that is an encouraging thought'.This means if you build up a bank of quotes and mentally separate them into modes. gandalf: softly spoken. disgruntled, annoyed. How well you are able to do this does depend on how well you've done your prepwork, how much you have watched and listened to the character.\nTIP 3: ACT FROM THE EYES\n(Clip from reservoir) My automatic trigger for Gandalf is to stoop my shoulders, and pull my face into position using these muscles around my eyes.If you study Ian Mcekellen's portrayal of Gandalf I always notice how these muscles contract. So much of his expression comes from the muscles around the eyes. They have a big impact on the voice. So I use the eyes as a physical trigger. It helps pull your instrument into place the mouth into shape. If you watch my impression videos, you will notice my most accurate vocal portrayal of gandalf during those softly spoken closeup monologues. Because I can cover all the physical triggers ian mckellen performs. When Ian required to be more conversational or even shouting. I don't get to use these observations so the impression suffers a bit. \nLEARNING FRAME\nFinally I will give you a learning frame to repeat alongside as you start or try to improve your gandalf impression:\n\nFarewell, my brave hobbits, my work is now finished, here at last, on the shores of the sea, comes the end of our fellowship, I will not say do not weep, for not all tears are an evil..."

Recently I have added Peaky Blinders and Marvel / Avengers characters to my arsenal!\n\nI currently run a number of series including:\nImpression Reels - The very best impressions I can do, Including LOTR, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Peaky Blinders, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Cartoons .etc\nImpression Challenges - Trying out new impressions in a less polished form.\nImpression Dramatic song covers - Voices of Reason.\nLow Budget Animation - Stickman sketch remakes of Iconic Tv shows and movies.\nHow to do Impressions - An audience lead tutorial series where I attempt to pass on my Impressions knowledge.\nDubs - Comedic dubs of iconic scenes with new dialogue, (My Peaky Blinders and Lord of The Rings dubs have grossed over 6 million views on Facebook)\nStandup - Clips from Standup sets I have performed over the last year.\nComedy Sketches - Comedy Sketches\n\nI started learning impressions in 2012, at the age of 20. You can follow my full impressions journey in my new \u2018How to do impressions\u2019 tutorial series\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Warwick in the summer 2013 he took 4 months out to concentrate on Youtube videos full time, including producing his most viewed video to date \u2018Morgan Freeman and 40 other impressions\u2019 with just over 12 million views. This foray into being a \u2018full time Youtuber\u2019 was cut short as he went travelling for 3 months before starting a 2 year teaching Graduate scheme with Charity \u2018Teach First\u2019.\n\nWhile teaching he has performed in and narrated the 4 episode series \u2018Lookalikes\u2019 as Morgan Freeman. The show and the narration received a positive reception. The show aired on Channel 4 during the prime time slot of Friday 10pm for three weeks. It is now currently available on Netflix. Charlie also performed with other well known impressionists for an unaired pilot.\n\nCharlie has worked for several prominent brands in relation to their products, including google and formula 1.\n\nSince the summer of 2016 Charlie has once again dived into the world of YouTube, for the first time producing content on a weekly basis. He is also focusing on live performance; he has performed in live venues a total of 3 times to date.\n\nHis top impressions include:\n\nMorgan Freeman (Red -Shawshank redemption)\nSir Ian McKellen (Gandalf \u2013 Lord of the Rings)\nAaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman \u2013 Breaking Bad)\nAlan Rickman (Snape \u2013 Harry Potter)\nMichael Caine (Alfred \u2013 Batman)\nJon Snow (Game of Thrones)\nJack Sparrow (Pirates of the Carribean)\nChristoph Waltz (Django Unchained, Inglorious bastards)\nAlec Guiness (Ben Kenobi \u2013 Star Wars)\nAgent Smith (The Matrix)\nSean Bean (Boromir \u2013 Lord of the Rings)\nRichard Armitage (Thorin Oakenshield \u2013 The Hobbit)\nCharles Dance (Tywin Lannister \u2013 Game of Thrones)\nTyrion Lannister (Game of Thrones)\nBryan Cranston (Walter White \u2013 Breaking Bad)\nFrank Underwood (House of Cards)\nTommy Shelby (Peaky Blinders)\n\nThe Equipment that I use:\nRecording Microphone: http://goo.gl/qGZCLT\nDSLR Camera: http://goo.gl/MPX4RC\nLens: http://goo.gl/7T7ZCH\nIntro Audio Mic: http://goo.gl/Azug4n\nRode Mic Stand: http://goo.gl/3IIgYW\nBOSE Headphones: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bose-QuietCo..."

What's the best haircut to get? the Cillian Murphy own brand, that's right the Tommy Shelby, unfortunately all I have is my sister with 3 youtube tutorials under here belt to give me that haircut. Oh and also we only have household objects to do it with! I could have gone for Arthur Shelby, as my hair was already long, but no, that would be cheating, so drink your whiskey, smoke your cigarettes, it's time to see my hair get butchered!

I hope Aberama Gold is ok. He looked fine. Hopefully Finn and Michael grey disappear. The actors are fine, but the characters are so annoying! that would be some of the best moments of season 6 if that was the case.\n\nAre the peaky blinders real? I watched a video on it and the answer was sort of. Also tommy quotes and edits, Tommy shelby, the real deal! The smoking 100 cigarettes a day real deal! let\u2019s hope he staves off death like a certain alfie solomons! He crosses the line that bloke! too often! c'ero vicino\nc'est quoi.\nDo you want some ASMR, most of their voices are pretty much ASMR. a s\u00e9rie\nPeaky Blinders won a bunch of awards recently, should I get some awards for my impressions impersonations and all round voices? Maybe if I dressed up they\u2019d give me the awards, behind the scenes and all that with cillian murphy and Tom hardy!

What's the best haircut to get? the Cillian Murphy own brand, that's right the Tommy Shelby, unfortunately all I have is my sister with 3 youtube tutorials under here belt to give me that haircut. Oh and also we only have household objects to do it with! I could have gone for Arthur Shelby, as my hair was already long, but no, that would be cheating, so drink your whiskey, smoke your cigarettes, it's time to see my hair get butchered! Plus a few impressions, Alfie solomons, Inspector Campbell, Arhutr Shelby and Even Aberama Gold under the guise of Littlefinger. But now I'm ringing Peaky blinders lookalikes for this fun lip sync video.\n\nAnyone looking forward to Season 6? I quite enjoyed peaky blinders season 5, is peaky blinders season 5 on Netflix yet? It is on Netflix apparently. If anyone knows of a season 6 trailer let me know! Has the cast started filming for season 6 yet? How will Tommy react to Oswald Mosley plan going tits up? bit of a blooper!

The actors are fine, but the characters are so annoying! that would be some of the best moments of season 6 if that was the case.\n\nAre the peaky blinders real? I watched a video on it and the answer was sort of. Also tommy quotes and edits, Tommy shelby, the real deal! The smoking 100 cigarettes a day real deal! let\u2019s hope he staves off death like a certain alfie solomons! He crosses the line that bloke! too often! c'ero vicino\nc'est quoi.\nDo you want some ASMR, most of their voices are pretty much ASMR. a s\u00e9rie\nPeaky Blinders won a bunch of awards recently, should I get some awards for my impressions impersonations and all round voices?

Gandalf and the gang are in for a rough old ride.\n\nCharlie Hopkinson is a comedic impressionist, impersonator, voice guy, whatever you want to call it who specialises in voices from current television shows and films. His standup is a character act about a retired maths teacher, his standup set includes impressions of Sir David Attenborough, Robin Williams, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Peaky Blinders, Tommy and Arthur Shelby and Gandalf from Lord of the Rings.\n\nAlways looking to update my roster I look to try out subscriber suggested impressions in the impressions challenge series before honing the best ones. Recently I have added Peaky Blinders and Marvel / Avengers characters to my arsenal!\n\nI currently run a number of series including:\nImpression Reels - The very best impressions I can do, Including LOTR, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Peaky Blinders, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Cartoons .etc\nImpression Challenges - Trying out new impressions in a less polished form.\nImpression Dramatic song covers - Voices of Reason.\nLow Budget Animation - Stickman sketch remakes of Iconic Tv shows and movies.\nHow to do Impressions - An audience lead tutorial series where I attempt to pass on my Impressions knowledge.\nDubs - Comedic dubs of iconic scenes with new dialogue, (My Peaky Blinders and Lord of The Rings dubs have grossed over 6 million views on Facebook)\nStandup - Clips from Standup sets I have performed over the last year.\nComedy Sketches - Comedy Sketches\n\nI started learning impressions in 2012, at the age of 20. You can follow my full impressions journey in my new \u2018How to do impressions\u2019 tutorial series\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Warwick in the summer 2013 he took 4 months out to concentrate on Youtube videos full time, including producing his most viewed video to date \u2018Morgan Freeman and 40 other impressions\u2019 with just over 12 million views. This foray into being a \u2018full time Youtuber\u2019 was cut short as he went travelling for 3 months before starting a 2 year teaching Graduate scheme with Charity \u2018Teach First\u2019.\n\nWhile teaching he has performed in and narrated the 4 episode series \u2018Lookalikes\u2019 as Morgan Freeman. The show and the narration received a positive reception. The show aired on Channel 4 during the prime time slot of Friday 10pm for three weeks. It is now currently available on Netflix. Charlie also performed with other well known impressionists for an unaired pilot.\n\nCharlie has worked for several prominent brands in relation to their products, including google and formula 1.\n\nSince the summer of 2016 Charlie has once again dived into the world of YouTube, for the first time producing content on a weekly basis. He is also focusing on live performance; he has performed in live venues a total of 3 times to date.\n\nHis top impressions include:\n\nMorgan Freeman (Red -Shawshank redemption)\nSir Ian McKellen (Gandalf \u2013 Lord of the Rings)\nAaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman \u2013 Breaking Bad)\nAlan Rickman (Snape \u2013 Harry Potter)\nMichael Caine (Alfred \u2013 Batman)\nJon Snow (Game of Thrones)\nJack Sparrow (Pirates of the Carribean)\nChristoph Waltz (Django Unchained, Inglorious bastards)\nAlec Guiness (Ben Kenobi \u2013 Star Wars)\nAgent Smith (The Matrix)\nSean Bean (Boromir \u2013 Lord of the Rings)\nRichard Armitage (Thorin Oakenshield \u2013 The Hobbit)\nCharles Dance (Tywin Lannister \u2013 Game of Thrones)\nTyrion Lannister (Game of Thrones)\nBryan Cranston (Walter White \u2013 Breaking Bad)\nFrank Underwood (House of Cards)\nTommy Shelby (Peaky Blinders)\n\nThe Equipment that I use:\nRecording Microphone: http://goo.gl/qGZCLT\nDSLR Camera: http://goo.gl/MPX4RC\nLens: http://goo.gl/7T7ZCH\nIntro Audio Mic: http://goo.gl/Azug4n\nRode Mic Stand: http://goo.gl/3IIgYW\nBOSE Headphones: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bose-QuietCo..."

His standup is a character act about a retired maths teacher, his standup set includes impressions of Sir David Attenborough, Robin Williams, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Peaky Blinders, Tommy and Arthur Shelby and Gandalf from Lord of the Rings.\n\nAlways looking to update my roster I look to try out subscriber suggested impressions in the impressions challenge series before honing the best ones. Recently I have added Peaky Blinders and Marvel / Avengers characters to my arsenal!\n\nI currently run a number of series including:\nImpression Reels - The very best impressions I can do, Including LOTR, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Peaky Blinders, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Cartoons .etc\nImpression Challenges - Trying out new impressions in a less polished form.\nImpression Dramatic song covers - Voices of Reason.\nLow Budget Animation - Stickman sketch remakes of Iconic Tv shows and movies.\nHow to do Impressions - An audience lead tutorial series where I attempt to pass on my Impressions knowledge.\nDubs - Comedic dubs of iconic scenes with new dialogue, (My Peaky Blinders and Lord of The Rings dubs have grossed over 6 million views on Facebook)\nStandup - Clips from Standup sets I have performed over the last year.\nComedy Sketches - Comedy Sketches\n\nI started learning impressions in 2012, at the age of 20. You can follow my full impressions journey in my new \u2018How to do impressions\u2019 tutorial series\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Warwick in the summer 2013 he took 4 months out to concentrate on Youtube videos full time, including producing his most viewed video to date \u2018Morgan Freeman and 40 other impressions\u2019 with just over 12 million views. This foray into being a \u2018full time Youtuber\u2019 was cut short as he went travelling for 3 months before starting a 2 year teaching Graduate scheme with Charity \u2018Teach First\u2019.\n\nWhile teaching he has performed in and narrated the 4 episode series \u2018Lookalikes\u2019 as Morgan Freeman. The show and the narration received a positive reception. The show aired on Channel 4 during the prime time slot of Friday 10pm for three weeks. It is now currently available on Netflix. Charlie also performed with other well known impressionists for an unaired pilot.\n\nCharlie has worked for several prominent brands in relation to their products, including google and formula 1.\n\nSince the summer of 2016 Charlie has once again dived into the world of YouTube, for the first time producing content on a weekly basis. He is also focusing on live performance; he has performed in live venues a total of 3 times to date.\n\nHis top impressions include:\n\nMorgan Freeman (Red -Shawshank redemption)\nSir Ian McKellen (Gandalf \u2013 Lord of the Rings)\nAaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman \u2013 Breaking Bad)\nAlan Rickman (Snape \u2013 Harry Potter)\nMichael Caine (Alfred \u2013 Batman)\nJon Snow (Game of Thrones)\nJack Sparrow (Pirates of the Carribean)\nChristoph Waltz (Django Unchained, Inglorious bastards)\nAlec Guiness (Ben Kenobi \u2013 Star Wars)\nAgent Smith (The Matrix)\nSean Bean (Boromir \u2013 Lord of the Rings)\nRichard Armitage (Thorin Oakenshield \u2013 The Hobbit)\nCharles Dance (Tywin Lannister \u2013 Game of Thrones)\nTyrion Lannister (Game of Thrones)\nBryan Cranston (Walter White \u2013 Breaking Bad)\nFrank Underwood (House of Cards)\nTommy Shelby (Peaky Blinders)\n\nThe Equipment that I use:\nRecording Microphone: http://goo.gl/qGZCLT\nDSLR Camera: http://goo.gl/MPX4RC\nLens: http://goo.gl/7T7ZCH\nIntro Audio Mic: http://goo.gl/Azug4n\nRode Mic Stand: http://goo.gl/3IIgYW\nBOSE Headphones: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bose-QuietCo...",

Featuring Inspector campbell, Arthur Shelby, John Shelby, Aberama Gold, Alfie Solomons, Luca Changretta and Tommy Shelby.\n\nAnyone looking forward to Season 6? I quite enjoyed peaky blinders season 5, is peaky blinders season 5 on Netflix yet? If anyone knows of a season 6 trailer let me know! Has the cast started filming for season 6 yet? How will Tommy react to Oswald Mosley plan going tits up? bit of a blooper! Red right hand by nick cave, what a song! what a soundtrack! huzzah! maybe I should cover it, oh wait I already did!\n\nAs you guys know I\u2019m a big fan of Peaky Blinders, the cast, haircuts, whiskey, hair, outfits, hats, you name it, I like it. Thats why I do all the peaky blinder cast impressions (even the women!, Ada and Polly!), birmingham accent and all (or not in some cases). \n\nWill Tom Hardy come back as Alfie Solomons in the new season, season 6? no spoilers, and no fighting! I hope Aberama Gold is ok. He looked fine. Hopefully Finn and Michael grey disappear. The actors are fine, but the characters are so annoying! that would be some of the best moments of season 6 if that was the case.\n\nAre the peaky blinders real? I watched a video on it and the answer was sort of. Also tommy quotes and edits, Tommy shelby, the real deal! The smoking 100 cigarettes a day real deal! let\u2019s hope he staves off death like a certain alfie solomons! He crosses the line that bloke! too often! c'ero vicino\nc'est quoi.\nDo you want some ASMR, most of their voices are pretty much ASMR. a s\u00e9rie\nPeaky Blinders won a bunch of awards recently, should I get some awards for my impressions impersonations and all round voices? Maybe if I dressed up they\u2019d give me the awards, behind the scenes and all that with cillian murphy and Tom hardy! Or maybe I\u2019ll just wait until season 6 of peaky blinders is on DVD.\n\nRough transcript:\nNow then I am Charlie Hopkinson and I'm going to give you the 7 best tips, one for each character and soon you'll be nailing all the Peaky Blinder Impressions.\nINTRO\n\nCHARLIE\n(2.Arfa's Shelby) Arfas voice is unhinged, He's got the loosest body language, so you want to practice doing the Arthur Walk, (Berlin clip) swinging those arms, and loosening up the neck. Once you can immediately adopt this body language your Arthur impression will be fire emoji or something.\nCHARLIE\n(Aberama Gold) I assume you can do a little finger impression, just do that. No, really, you want to take a southern irish accent, and imagine as you're doing it focus what it's like to be in love with sansa, no but seriously, I want you to focus on the mouth shape. Imagine your mouth is an instrument, it's like hole end, the end with the hole in it, the shape of it, alters the sound that comes out. My Tip for Aberama gold is keep your lips pursed into a slightly lopsided smile, and deliver it halfway between regular talking and a whisper. and then Imagine yourself climbing a ladder, a chaos ladder.\nCHARLIE\n(John Shelby) Probably the weakest of the ones I can do. But it's the most brummy of the accents. Here's a clip you probably remember from the show. Remember that episode, the one where they watch the champions league final and Tommy's william hill account get's blocked. For John, start with your tommy impression, add more to the crummy accent, but Add a quality that's halfway between a gangster and an impudent child. Nah I aint doing it, I won't eat my damn vegetables. I want Sweets, sweets and a bag of cocaine.\nCHARLIE\n(Alfie Solomons) Alfie, Alfie Solomons, yeah, right. One trick you can use for Alfie is to look forward, talking, while they're there and then at the last moment, look them in the eye. It's a power play right. But the key thing for Alfie, is to add the grunts and noises around it, here are some you might want to add. (Grunt super cut).\nCHARLIE\n(Luca Changretta) Do a Marlon Brando impression.\nCHARLIE\n(Tommy Shelby) I think the Tommy shelby sounds best when it is 30% of the way between a whisper and Here's an exercise I want you to try when doing Tommy Shelby to say the words at almost a whisper, and just say a shadow of the word, yeah, alright, ok, \u00a0yeah, everybody, agreed, yeah. If you do your normal Tommy Shelby impression, and then every so often go into this whispery mode you'll find it really starts to take shape. (Outside) Also, pin your shoulders back and stick your neck out, that should be the default position for delivering Tommy Shelby impression.",

Featuring Inspector campbell, Arthur Shelby, John Shelby, Aberama Gold, Alfie Solomons, Luca Changretta and Tommy Shelby.\n\nAnyone looking forward to Season 6? I quite enjoyed peaky blinders season 5, is peaky blinders season 5 on Netflix yet? If anyone knows of a season 6 trailer let me know! Has the cast started filming for season 6 yet? How will Tommy react to Oswald Mosley plan going tits up? bit of a blooper! Red right hand by nick cave, what a song! what a soundtrack! huzzah! maybe I should cover it, oh wait I already did!\n\nAs you guys know I\u2019m a big fan of Peaky Blinders, the cast, haircuts, whiskey, hair, outfits, hats, you name it, I like it. Thats why I do all the peaky blinder cast impressions (even the women!, Ada and Polly!), birmingham accent and all (or not in some cases). \n\nWill Tom Hardy come back as Alfie Solomons in the new season, season 6? no spoilers, and no fighting! I hope Aberama Gold is ok. He looked fine. Hopefully Finn and Michael grey disappear. The actors are fine, but the characters are so annoying! that would be some of the best moments of season 6 if that was the case.\n\nAre the peaky blinders real? I watched a video on it and the answer was sort of. Also tommy quotes and edits, Tommy shelby, the real deal! The smoking 100 cigarettes a day real deal! let\u2019s hope he staves off death like a certain alfie solomons! He crosses the line that bloke! too often! c'ero vicino\nc'est quoi.\nDo you want some ASMR, most of their voices are pretty much ASMR. a s\u00e9rie\nPeaky Blinders won a bunch of awards recently, should I get some awards for my impressions impersonations and all round voices? Maybe if I dressed up they\u2019d give me the awards, behind the scenes and all that with cillian murphy and Tom hardy! Or maybe I\u2019ll just wait until season 6 of peaky blinders is on DVD.\n\nRough transcript:\nNow then I am Charlie Hopkinson and I'm going to give you the 7 best tips, one for each character and soon you'll be nailing all the Peaky Blinder Impressions.\nINTRO\n\nCHARLIE\n(2.Arfa's Shelby) Arfas voice is unhinged, He's got the loosest body language, so you want to practice doing the Arthur Walk, (Berlin clip) swinging those arms, and loosening up the neck. Once you can immediately adopt this body language your Arthur impression will be fire emoji or something.\nCHARLIE\n(Aberama Gold) I assume you can do a little finger impression, just do that. No, really, you want to take a southern irish accent, and imagine as you're doing it focus what it's like to be in love with sansa, no but seriously, I want you to focus on the mouth shape. Imagine your mouth is an instrument, it's like hole end, the end with the hole in it, the shape of it, alters the sound that comes out. My Tip for Aberama gold is keep your lips pursed into a slightly lopsided smile, and deliver it halfway between regular talking and a whisper. and then Imagine yourself climbing a ladder, a chaos ladder.\nCHARLIE\n(John Shelby) Probably the weakest of the ones I can do. But it's the most brummy of the accents. Here's a clip you probably remember from the show. Remember that episode, the one where they watch the champions league final and Tommy's william hill account get's blocked. For John, start with your tommy impression, add more to the crummy accent, but Add a quality that's halfway between a gangster and an impudent child. Nah I aint doing it, I won't eat my damn vegetables. I want Sweets, sweets and a bag of cocaine.\nCHARLIE\n(Alfie Solomons) Alfie, Alfie Solomons, yeah, right. One trick you can use for Alfie is to look forward, talking, while they're there and then at the last moment, look them in the eye. It's a power play right. But the key thing for Alfie, is to add the grunts and noises around it, here are some you might want to add. (Grunt super cut).\nCHARLIE\n(Luca Changretta) Do a Marlon Brando impression.\nCHARLIE\n(Tommy Shelby) I think the Tommy shelby sounds best when it is 30% of the way between a whisper and Here's an exercise I want you to try when doing Tommy Shelby to say the words at almost a whisper, and just say a shadow of the word, yeah, alright, ok, \u00a0yeah, everybody, agreed, yeah. If you do your normal Tommy Shelby impression, and then every so often go into this whispery mode you'll find it really starts to take shape. (Outside) Also, pin your shoulders back and stick your neck out, that should be the default position for delivering Tommy Shelby impression."

His standup is a character act about a retired maths teacher, his standup set includes impressions of Sir David Attenborough, Robin Williams, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Peaky Blinders, Tommy and Arthur Shelby and Gandalf from Lord of the Rings.\n\nAlways looking to update my roster I look to try out subscriber suggested impressions in the impressions challenge series before honing the best ones. Recently I have added Peaky Blinders and Marvel / Avengers characters to my arsenal!\n\nI currently run a number of series including:\nImpression Reels - The very best impressions I can do, Including LOTR, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Peaky Blinders, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Cartoons .etc\nImpression Challenges - Trying out new impressions in a less polished form.\nImpression Dramatic song covers - Voices of Reason.\nLow Budget Animation - Stickman sketch remakes of Iconic Tv shows and movies.\nHow to do Impressions - An audience lead tutorial series where I attempt to pass on my Impressions knowledge.\nDubs - Comedic dubs of iconic scenes with new dialogue, (My Peaky Blinders and Lord of The Rings dubs have grossed over 6 million views on Facebook)\nStandup - Clips from Standup sets I have performed over the last year.\nComedy Sketches - Comedy Sketches\n\nI started learning impressions in 2012, at the age of 20. You can follow my full impressions journey in my new \u2018How to do impressions\u2019 tutorial series\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Warwick in the summer 2013 he took 4 months out to concentrate on Youtube videos full time, including producing his most viewed video to date \u2018Morgan Freeman and 40 other impressions\u2019 with just over 12 million views. This foray into being a \u2018full time Youtuber\u2019 was cut short as he went travelling for 3 months before starting a 2 year teaching Graduate scheme with Charity \u2018Teach First\u2019.\n\nWhile teaching he has performed in and narrated the 4 episode series \u2018Lookalikes\u2019 as Morgan Freeman. The show and the narration received a positive reception. The show aired on Channel 4 during the prime time slot of Friday 10pm for three weeks. It is now currently available on Netflix. Charlie also performed with other well known impressionists for an unaired pilot.\n\nCharlie has worked for several prominent brands in relation to their products, including google and formula 1.\n\nSince the summer of 2016 Charlie has once again dived into the world of YouTube, for the first time producing content on a weekly basis.

Recently I have added Peaky Blinders and Marvel / Avengers characters to my arsenal!\n\nI currently run a number of series including:\nImpression Reels - The very best impressions I can do, Including LOTR, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Peaky Blinders, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Cartoons .etc\nImpression Challenges - Trying out new impressions in a less polished form.\nImpression Dramatic song covers - Voices of Reason.\nLow Budget Animation - Stickman sketch remakes of Iconic Tv shows and movies.\nHow to do Impressions - An audience lead tutorial series where I attempt to pass on my Impressions knowledge.\nDubs - Comedic dubs of iconic scenes with new dialogue, (My Peaky Blinders and Lord of The Rings dubs have grossed over 6 million views on Facebook)\nStandup - Clips from Standup sets I have performed over the last year.\nComedy Sketches - Comedy Sketches\n\nI started learning impressions in 2012, at the age of 20. You can follow my full impressions journey in my new \u2018How to do impressions\u2019 tutorial series\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Warwick in the summer 2013 he took 4 months out to concentrate on Youtube videos full time, including producing his most viewed video to date \u2018Morgan Freeman and 40 other impressions\u2019 with just over 12 million views. This foray into being a \u2018full time Youtuber\u2019 was cut short as he went travelling for 3 months before starting a 2 year teaching Graduate scheme with Charity \u2018Teach First\u2019.\n\nWhile teaching he has performed in and narrated the 4 episode series \u2018Lookalikes\u2019 as Morgan Freeman. The show and the narration received a positive reception. The show aired on Channel 4 during the prime time slot of Friday 10pm for three weeks. It is now currently available on Netflix. Charlie also performed with other well known impressionists for an unaired pilot.\n\nCharlie has worked for several prominent brands in relation to their products, including google and formula 1.\n\nSince the summer of 2016 Charlie has once again dived into the world of YouTube, for the first time producing content on a weekly basis. He is also focusing on live performance; he has performed in live venues a total of 3 times to date.\n\nHis top impressions include:\n\nMorgan Freeman (Red -Shawshank redemption)\nSir Ian McKellen (Gandalf \u2013 Lord of the Rings)\nAaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman \u2013 Breaking Bad)\nAlan Rickman (Snape \u2013 Harry Potter)\nMichael Caine (Alfred \u2013 Batman)\nJon Snow (Game of Thrones)\nJack Sparrow (Pirates of the Carribean)\nChristoph Waltz (Django Unchained, Inglorious bastards)\nAlec Guiness (Ben Kenobi \u2013 Star Wars)\nAgent Smith (The Matrix)\nSean Bean (Boromir \u2013 Lord of the Rings)\nRichard Armitage (Thorin Oakenshield \u2013 The Hobbit)\nCharles Dance (Tywin Lannister \u2013 Game of Thrones)\nTyrion Lannister (Game of Thrones)\nBryan Cranston (Walter White \u2013 Breaking Bad)\nFrank Underwood (House of Cards)\nTommy Shelby (Peaky Blinders)\n\nThe Equipment that I use:\nRecording Microphone: http://goo.gl/qGZCLT\nDSLR Camera: http://goo.gl/MPX4RC\nLens: http://goo.gl/7T7ZCH\nIntro Audio Mic: http://goo.gl/Azug4n\nRode Mic Stand: http://goo.gl/3IIgYW\nBOSE Headphones: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bose-QuietCo..."

Recently I have added Peaky Blinders and Marvel / Avengers characters to my arsenal!\n\nAnyone looking forward to Season 6? I quite enjoyed peaky blinders season 5, is peaky blinders season 5 on Netflix yet? If anyone knows of a season 6 trailer let me know! Has the cast started filming for season 6 yet? How will Tommy react to Oswald Mosley plan going tits up? bit of a blooper! Red right hand by nick cave, what a song! what a soundtrack! huzzah! maybe I should cover it, oh wait I already did!\n\nAs you guys know I\u2019m a big fan of Peaky Blinders, the cast, haircuts, whiskey, hair, outfits, hats, you name it, I like it. Thats why I do all the peaky blinder cast impressions (even the women!, Ada and Polly!), birmingham accent and all (or not in some cases). \n\nWill Tom Hardy come back as Alfie Solomons in the new season, season 6? no spoilers, and no fighting! I hope Aberama Gold is ok. He looked fine. Hopefully Finn and Michael grey disappear. The actors are fine, but the characters are so annoying! that would be some of the best moments of season 6 if that was the case.\n\nAre the peaky blinders real? I watched a video on it and the answer was sort of. and tommy quotes and edits, Tommy shelby, the real deal! The smoking 100 cigarettes a day real deal! let\u2019s hope he staves off death like a certain alfie solomons! He crosses the line that bloke! too often! c'ero vicino\nc'est quoi.\nDo you want some ASMR, most of their voices are pretty much ASMR. a s\u00e9rie\nPeaky Blinders won a bunch of awards recently, should I get some awards for my impressions impersonations and all round voices? Maybe if I dressed up they\u2019d give me the awards, behind the scenes and all that with cillian murphy and Tom hardy! Or maybe I\u2019ll just wait until season 6 of peaky blinders is on DVD.\n\n\nRough transcript:\n\nArthur Shelby: Snoop\nSnoop\nWhen the pimp's in the crib ma\nDrop it like it's hot\nDrop it like it's hot\nDrop it like it's hot\nTommy Shelby: When the pigs try to get at you\nPark it like it's hot\nPark it like it's hot\nPark it like it's hot\nJohn Shelby: And if a Peaky get a attitude\nPop it like it's hot\nPop it like it's hot\nPop it like it's hot\nAberama Gold: I got the Rolly on my arm and I'm pouring Chandon\nAnd I roll the best weed cause I got it going on\nUh!

Also included, aberama gold, Alfie Solomons, Polly Grey and Luca Changretta.\n\nCharlie Hopkinson is a comedic impressionist, impersonator, voice guy, whatever you want to call it who specialises in voices from current television shows and films. His standup is a character act about a retired maths teacher, his standup set includes impressions of Sir David Attenborough, Robin Williams, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Peaky Blinders, Tommy and Arthur Shelby and Gandalf from Lord of the Rings.\n\nAlways looking to update my roster I look to try out subscriber suggested impressions in the impressions challenge series before honing the best ones. Recently I have added Peaky Blinders and Marvel / Avengers characters to my arsenal!\n\nAnyone looking forward to Season 6? I quite enjoyed peaky blinders season 5, is peaky blinders season 5 on Netflix yet? If anyone knows of a season 6 trailer let me know! Has the cast started filming for season 6 yet? How will Tommy react to Oswald Mosley plan going tits up? bit of a blooper! Red right hand by nick cave, what a song! what a soundtrack! huzzah! maybe I should cover it, oh wait I already did!\n\nAs you guys know I\u2019m a big fan of Peaky Blinders, the cast, haircuts, whiskey, hair, outfits, hats, you name it, I like it. Thats why I do all the peaky blinder cast impressions (even the women!, Ada and Polly!), birmingham accent and all (or not in some cases). \n\nWill Tom Hardy come back as Alfie Solomons in the new season, season 6? no spoilers, and no fighting! I hope Aberama Gold is ok. He looked fine. Hopefully Finn and Michael grey disappear. The actors are fine, but the characters are so annoying! that would be some of the best moments of season 6 if that was the case.\n\nAre the peaky blinders real? I watched a video on it and the answer was sort of. and tommy quotes and edits, Tommy shelby, the real deal! The smoking 100 cigarettes a day real deal! let\u2019s hope he staves off death like a certain alfie solomons! He crosses the line that bloke! too often! c'ero vicino\nc'est quoi.\nDo you want some ASMR, most of their voices are pretty much ASMR. a s\u00e9rie\nPeaky Blinders won a bunch of awards recently, should I get some awards for my impressions impersonations and all round voices? Maybe if I dressed up they\u2019d give me the awards, behind the scenes and all that with cillian murphy and Tom hardy! Or maybe I\u2019ll just wait until season 6 of peaky blinders is on DVD.\n\n\nRough transcript:\n\nArthur Shelby: Snoop\nSnoop\nWhen the pimp's in the crib ma\nDrop it like it's hot\nDrop it like it's hot\nDrop it like it's hot\nTommy Shelby: When the pigs try to get at you\nPark it like it's hot\nPark it like it's hot\nPark it like it's hot\nJohn Shelby: And if a Peaky get a attitude\nPop it like it's hot\nPop it like it's hot\nPop it like it's hot\nAberama Gold: I got the Rolly on my arm and I'm pouring Chandon\nAnd I roll the best weed cause I got it going on\nUh! I'm a nice dude, with some nice dreams\nSee these ice cubes, see these Ice Creams?\nInspector Campbell: Eligible bachelor, million dollar boat\nThat's whiter than what's spilling down your throat\nPolly Grey: The Phantom, exterior like fish eggs\nThe interior like suicide wrist red\nLuca Changretta: I can exercise you, this can be your Phys. Ed\nCheat on your man ma, that's how you get ahizzead\nTommy Shelby: Killer wit the beat, I know killers in the street\nWit' the steel that'll make you feel like Chinchilla in the heat\nSo don't try to run up on my ear talking all that raspy shit\nTrying to ask me shit\nAlfie Solomons: When my Peakys fill ya vest they ain't gon pass me shit\nYou should think about it, take a second\nMatter fact, you should take four B\nAnd think before you fuck wit lil' skateboard P\nWhen the pimp's in the crib ma Arthur, drop it like it's hot\nDrop it like it's hot\nDrop it like it's hot\nDrop it like it's hot"

Recently I have added Peaky Blinders and Marvel / Avengers characters to my arsenal!\n\nI currently run a number of series including:\nImpression Reels - The very best impressions I can do, Including LOTR, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Peaky Blinders, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Cartoons .etc\nImpression Challenges - Trying out new impressions in a less polished form.\nImpression Dramatic song covers - Voices of Reason.\nLow Budget Animation - Stickman sketch remakes of Iconic Tv shows and movies.\nHow to do Impressions - An audience lead tutorial series where I attempt to pass on my Impressions knowledge.\nDubs - Comedic dubs of iconic scenes with new dialogue, (My Peaky Blinders and Lord of The Rings dubs have grossed over 6 million views on Facebook)\nStandup - Clips from Standup sets I have performed over the last year.\nComedy Sketches - Comedy Sketches\n\nI started learning impressions in 2012, at the age of 20. You can follow my full impressions journey in my new \u2018How to do impressions\u2019 tutorial series\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Warwick in the summer 2013 he took 4 months out to concentrate on Youtube videos full time, including producing his most viewed video to date \u2018Morgan Freeman and 40 other impressions\u2019 with just over 12 million views. This foray into being a \u2018full time Youtuber\u2019 was cut short as he went travelling for 3 months before starting a 2 year teaching Graduate scheme with Charity \u2018Teach First\u2019.\n\nWhile teaching he has performed in and narrated the 4 episode series \u2018Lookalikes\u2019 as Morgan Freeman. The show and the narration received a positive reception. The show aired on Channel 4 during the prime time slot of Friday 10pm for three weeks. It is now currently available on Netflix. Charlie also performed with other well known impressionists for an unaired pilot.\n\nCharlie has worked for several prominent brands in relation to their products, including google and formula 1.\n\nSince the summer of 2016 Charlie has once again dived into the world of YouTube, for the first time producing content on a weekly basis. He is also focusing on live performance; he has performed in live venues a total of 3 times to date.\n\nHis top impressions include:\n\nMorgan Freeman (Red -Shawshank redemption)\nSir Ian McKellen (Gandalf \u2013 Lord of the Rings)\nAaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman \u2013 Breaking Bad)\nAlan Rickman (Snape \u2013 Harry Potter)\nMichael Caine (Alfred \u2013 Batman)\nJon Snow (Game of Thrones)\nJack Sparrow (Pirates of the Carribean)\nChristoph Waltz (Django Unchained, Inglorious bastards)\nAlec Guiness (Ben Kenobi \u2013 Star Wars)\nAgent Smith (The Matrix)\nSean Bean (Boromir \u2013 Lord of the Rings)\nRichard Armitage (Thorin Oakenshield \u2013 The Hobbit)\nCharles Dance (Tywin Lannister \u2013 Game of Thrones)\nTyrion Lannister (Game of Thrones)\nBryan Cranston (Walter White \u2013 Breaking Bad)\nFrank Underwood (House of Cards)\nTommy Shelby (Peaky Blinders)\n\nThe Equipment that I use:\nRecording Microphone: http://goo.gl/qGZCLT\nDSLR Camera: http://goo.gl/MPX4RC\nLens: http://goo.gl/7T7ZCH\nIntro Audio Mic: http://goo.gl/Azug4n\nRode Mic Stand: http://goo.gl/3IIgYW\nBOSE Headphones: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bose-QuietCo...",

His standup is a character act about a retired maths teacher, his standup set includes impressions of Sir David Attenborough, Robin Williams, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Peaky Blinders, Tommy and Arthur Shelby and Gandalf from Lord of the Rings.\n\nAlways looking to update my roster I look to try out subscriber suggested impressions in the impressions challenge series before honing the best ones. Recently I have added Peaky Blinders and Marvel / Avengers characters to my arsenal!\n\nI currently run a number of series including:\nImpression Reels - The very best impressions I can do, Including LOTR, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Peaky Blinders, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Cartoons .etc\nImpression Challenges - Trying out new impressions in a less polished form.\nImpression Dramatic song covers - Voices of Reason.\nLow Budget Animation - Stickman sketch remakes of Iconic Tv shows and movies.\nHow to do Impressions - An audience lead tutorial series where I attempt to pass on my Impressions knowledge.\nDubs - Comedic dubs of iconic scenes with new dialogue, (My Peaky Blinders and Lord of The Rings dubs have grossed over 6 million views on Facebook)\nStandup - Clips from Standup sets I have performed over the last year.\nComedy Sketches - Comedy Sketches\n\nI started learning impressions in 2012, at the age of 20. You can follow my full impressions journey in my new \u2018How to do impressions\u2019 tutorial series\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Warwick in the summer 2013 he took 4 months out to concentrate on Youtube videos full time, including producing his most viewed video to date \u2018Morgan Freeman and 40 other impressions\u2019 with just over 12 million views. This foray into being a \u2018full time Youtuber\u2019 was cut short as he went travelling for 3 months before starting a 2 year teaching Graduate scheme with Charity \u2018Teach First\u2019.\n\nWhile teaching he has performed in and narrated the 4 episode series \u2018Lookalikes\u2019 as Morgan Freeman. The show and the narration received a positive reception. The show aired on Channel 4 during the prime time slot of Friday 10pm for three weeks. It is now currently available on Netflix. Charlie also performed with other well known impressionists for an unaired pilot.\n\nCharlie has worked for several prominent brands in relation to their products, including google and formula 1.\n\nSince the summer of 2016 Charlie has once again dived into the world of YouTube, for the first time producing content on a weekly basis. He is also focusing on live performance; he has performed in live venues a total of 3 times to date.\n\nHis top impressions include:\n\nMorgan Freeman (Red -Shawshank redemption)\nSir Ian McKellen (Gandalf \u2013 Lord of the Rings)\nAaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman \u2013 Breaking Bad)\nAlan Rickman (Snape \u2013 Harry Potter)\nMichael Caine (Alfred \u2013 Batman)\nJon Snow (Game of Thrones)\nJack Sparrow (Pirates of the Carribean)\nChristoph Waltz (Django Unchained, Inglorious bastards)\nAlec Guiness (Ben Kenobi \u2013 Star Wars)\nAgent Smith (The Matrix)\nSean Bean (Boromir \u2013 Lord of the Rings)\nRichard Armitage (Thorin Oakenshield \u2013 The Hobbit)\nCharles Dance (Tywin Lannister \u2013 Game of Thrones)\nTyrion Lannister (Game of Thrones)\nBryan Cranston (Walter White \u2013 Breaking Bad)\nFrank Underwood (House of Cards)\nTommy Shelby (Peaky Blinders)\n\nThe Equipment that I use:\nRecording Microphone: http://goo.gl/qGZCLT\nDSLR Camera: http://goo.gl/MPX4RC\nLens: http://goo.gl/7T7ZCH\nIntro Audio Mic: http://goo.gl/Azug4n\nRode Mic Stand: http://goo.gl/3IIgYW\nBOSE Headphones: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bose-QuietCo...",

                "description": "Full impressions course: https://skl.sh/3dmmGr6\n\nCharlie Hopkinson is a comedic impressionist, impersonator, voice guy, whatever you want to call it who specialises in voices from current television shows and films. His standup is a character act about a retired maths teacher, his standup set includes impressions of Sir David Attenborough, Robin Williams, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Peaky Blinders, Tommy and Arthur Shelby and Gandalf from Lord of the Rings.\n\nAlways looking to update my roster I look to try out subscriber suggested impressions in the impressions challenge series before honing the best ones. Recently I have added Peaky Blinders and Marvel / Avengers characters to my arsenal!\n\nI currently run a number of series including:\nImpression Reels - The very best impressions I can do, Including LOTR, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Peaky Blinders, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Cartoons .etc\nImpression Challenges - Trying out new impressions in a less polished form.\nImpression Dramatic song covers - Voices of Reason.\nLow Budget Animation - Stickman sketch remakes of Iconic Tv shows and movies.\nHow to do Impressions - An audience lead tutorial series where I attempt to pass on my Impressions knowledge.\nDubs - Comedic dubs of iconic scenes with new dialogue, (My Peaky Blinders and Lord of The Rings dubs have grossed over 6 million views on Facebook)\nStandup - Clips from Standup sets I have performed over the last year.\nComedy Sketches - Comedy Sketches\n\nAnyone looking forward to Season 6? I quite enjoyed peaky blinders season 5, is peaky blinders season 5 on Netflix yet? If anyone knows of a season 6 trailer let me know! Has the cast started filming for season 6 yet? How will Tommy react to Oswald Mosley plan going tits up? bit of a blooper! Red right hand by nick cave, what a song! what a soundtrack! huzzah! maybe I should cover it, oh wait I already did!\n\nAs you guys know I\u2019m a big fan of Peaky Blinders, the cast, haircuts, whiskey, hair, outfits, hats, you name it, I like it. Thats why I do all the peaky blinder cast impressions (even the women!, Ada and Polly!), birmingham accent and all (or not in some cases). \n\nWill Tom Hardy come back as Alfie Solomons in the new season, season 6? no spoilers, and no fighting! I hope Aberama Gold is ok. He looked fine. Hopefully Finn and Michael grey disappear. The actors are fine, but the characters are so annoying! that would be some of the best moments of season 6 if that was the case.\n\nAre the peaky blinders real? I watched a video on it and the answer was sort of. and tommy quotes and edits, Tommy shelby, the real deal! The smoking 100 cigarettes a day real deal! let\u2019s hope he staves off death like a certain alfie solomons! He crosses the line that bloke! too often! c'ero vicino\nc'est quoi.\nDo you want some ASMR, most of their voices are pretty much ASMR. a s\u00e9rie\nPeaky Blinders won a bunch of awards recently, should I get some awards for my impressions impersonations and all round voices? Maybe if I dressed up they\u2019d give me the awards, behind the scenes and all that with cillian murphy and Tom hardy! Or maybe I\u2019ll just wait until season 6 of peaky blinders is on DVD.\n\n\n\nHis top impressions include:\n\nMorgan Freeman (Red -Shawshank redemption)\nSir Ian McKellen (Gandalf \u2013 Lord of the Rings)\nAaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman \u2013 Breaking Bad)\nAlan Rickman (Snape \u2013 Harry Potter)\nMichael Caine (Alfred \u2013 Batman)\nJon Snow (Game of Thrones)\nJack Sparrow (Pirates of the Carribean)\nChristoph Waltz (Django Unchained, Inglorious bastards)\nAlec Guiness (Ben Kenobi \u2013 Star Wars)\nAgent Smith (The Matrix)\nSean Bean (Boromir \u2013 Lord of the Rings)\nRichard Armitage (Thorin Oakenshield \u2013 The Hobbit)\nCharles Dance (Tywin Lannister \u2013 Game of Thrones)\nTyrion Lannister (Game of Thrones)\nBryan Cranston (Walter White \u2013 Breaking Bad)\nFrank Underwood (House of Cards)\nTommy Shelby (Peaky Blinders)\n\nThe Equipment that I use:\nRecording Microphone: http://goo.gl/qGZCLT\nDSLR Camera: http://goo.gl/MPX4RC\nLens: http://goo.gl/7T7ZCH\nIntro Audio Mic: http://goo.gl/Azug4n\nRode Mic Stand: http://goo.gl/3IIgYW\nBOSE Headphones: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bose-QuietCo...",

                    "description": "Full impressions course: https://skl.sh/3dmmGr6\n\nCharlie Hopkinson is a comedic impressionist, impersonator, voice guy, whatever you want to call it who specialises in voices from current television shows and films. His standup is a character act about a retired maths teacher, his standup set includes impressions of Sir David Attenborough, Robin Williams, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Peaky Blinders, Tommy and Arthur Shelby and Gandalf from Lord of the Rings.\n\nAlways looking to update my roster I look to try out subscriber suggested impressions in the impressions challenge series before honing the best ones. Recently I have added Peaky Blinders and Marvel / Avengers characters to my arsenal!\n\nI currently run a number of series including:\nImpression Reels - The very best impressions I can do, Including LOTR, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Peaky Blinders, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Cartoons .etc\nImpression Challenges - Trying out new impressions in a less polished form.\nImpression Dramatic song covers - Voices of Reason.\nLow Budget Animation - Stickman sketch remakes of Iconic Tv shows and movies.\nHow to do Impressions - An audience lead tutorial series where I attempt to pass on my Impressions knowledge.\nDubs - Comedic dubs of iconic scenes with new dialogue, (My Peaky Blinders and Lord of The Rings dubs have grossed over 6 million views on Facebook)\nStandup - Clips from Standup sets I have performed over the last year.\nComedy Sketches - Comedy Sketches\n\nAnyone looking forward to Season 6? I quite enjoyed peaky blinders season 5, is peaky blinders season 5 on Netflix yet? If anyone knows of a season 6 trailer let me know! Has the cast started filming for season 6 yet? How will Tommy react to Oswald Mosley plan going tits up? bit of a blooper! Red right hand by nick cave, what a song! what a soundtrack! huzzah! maybe I should cover it, oh wait I already did!\n\nAs you guys know I\u2019m a big fan of Peaky Blinders, the cast, haircuts, whiskey, hair, outfits, hats, you name it, I like it. Thats why I do all the peaky blinder cast impressions (even the women!, Ada and Polly!), birmingham accent and all (or not in some cases). \n\nWill Tom Hardy come back as Alfie Solomons in the new season, season 6? no spoilers, and no fighting! I hope Aberama Gold is ok. He looked fine. Hopefully Finn and Michael grey disappear. The actors are fine, but the characters are so annoying! that would be some of the best moments of season 6 if that was the case.\n\nAre the peaky blinders real? I watched a video on it and the answer was sort of. and tommy quotes and edits, Tommy shelby, the real deal! The smoking 100 cigarettes a day real deal! let\u2019s hope he staves off death like a certain alfie solomons! He crosses the line that bloke! too often! c'ero vicino\nc'est quoi.\nDo you want some ASMR, most of their voices are pretty much ASMR. a s\u00e9rie\nPeaky Blinders won a bunch of awards recently, should I get some awards for my impressions impersonations and all round voices? Maybe if I dressed up they\u2019d give me the awards, behind the scenes and all that with cillian murphy and Tom hardy! Or maybe I\u2019ll just wait until season 6 of peaky blinders is on DVD.\n\n\n\nHis top impressions include:\n\nMorgan Freeman (Red -Shawshank redemption)\nSir Ian McKellen (Gandalf \u2013 Lord of the Rings)\nAaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman \u2013 Breaking Bad)\nAlan Rickman (Snape \u2013 Harry Potter)\nMichael Caine (Alfred \u2013 Batman)\nJon Snow (Game of Thrones)\nJack Sparrow (Pirates of the Carribean)\nChristoph Waltz (Django Unchained, Inglorious bastards)\nAlec Guiness (Ben Kenobi \u2013 Star Wars)\nAgent Smith (The Matrix)\nSean Bean (Boromir \u2013 Lord of the Rings)\nRichard Armitage (Thorin Oakenshield \u2013 The Hobbit)\nCharles Dance (Tywin Lannister \u2013 Game of Thrones)\nTyrion Lannister (Game of Thrones)\nBryan Cranston (Walter White \u2013 Breaking Bad)\nFrank Underwood (House of Cards)\nTommy Shelby (Peaky Blinders)\n\nThe Equipment that I use:\nRecording Microphone: http://goo.gl/qGZCLT\nDSLR Camera: http://goo.gl/MPX4RC\nLens: http://goo.gl/7T7ZCH\nIntro Audio Mic: http://goo.gl/Azug4n\nRode Mic Stand: http://goo.gl/3IIgYW\nBOSE Headphones: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bose-QuietCo..."

Recently I have added Peaky Blinders and Marvel / Avengers characters to my arsenal!\n\nI currently run a number of series including:\nImpression Reels - The very best impressions I can do, Including LOTR, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Peaky Blinders, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Cartoons .etc\nImpression Challenges - Trying out new impressions in a less polished form.\nImpression Dramatic song covers - Voices of Reason.\nLow Budget Animation - Stickman sketch remakes of Iconic Tv shows and movies.\nHow to do Impressions - An audience lead tutorial series where I attempt to pass on my Impressions knowledge.\nDubs - Comedic dubs of iconic scenes with new dialogue, (My Peaky Blinders and Lord of The Rings dubs have grossed over 6 million views on Facebook)\nStandup - Clips from Standup sets I have performed over the last year.\nComedy Sketches - Comedy Sketches\n\nI started learning impressions in 2012, at the age of 20. You can follow my full impressions journey in my new \u2018How to do impressions\u2019 tutorial series\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Warwick in the summer 2013 he took 4 months out to concentrate on Youtube videos full time, including producing his most viewed video to date \u2018Morgan Freeman and 40 other impressions\u2019 with just over 12 million views. This foray into being a \u2018full time Youtuber\u2019 was cut short as he went travelling for 3 months before starting a 2 year teaching Graduate scheme with Charity \u2018Teach First\u2019.\n\nWhile teaching he has performed in and narrated the 4 episode series \u2018Lookalikes\u2019 as Morgan Freeman. The show and the narration received a positive reception. The show aired on Channel 4 during the prime time slot of Friday 10pm for three weeks. It is now currently available on Netflix. Charlie also performed with other well known impressionists for an unaired pilot.\n\nCharlie has worked for several prominent brands in relation to their products, including google and formula 1.\n\nSince the summer of 2016 Charlie has once again dived into the world of YouTube, for the first time producing content on a weekly basis. He is also focusing on live performance; he has performed in live venues a total of 3 times to date.\n\nHis top impressions include:\n\nMorgan Freeman (Red -Shawshank redemption)\nSir Ian McKellen (Gandalf \u2013 Lord of the Rings)\nAaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman \u2013 Breaking Bad)\nAlan Rickman (Snape \u2013 Harry Potter)\nMichael Caine (Alfred \u2013 Batman)\nJon Snow (Game of Thrones)\nJack Sparrow (Pirates of the Carribean)\nChristoph Waltz (Django Unchained, Inglorious bastards)\nAlec Guiness (Ben Kenobi \u2013 Star Wars)\nAgent Smith (The Matrix)\nSean Bean (Boromir \u2013 Lord of the Rings)\nRichard Armitage (Thorin Oakenshield \u2013 The Hobbit)\nCharles Dance (Tywin Lannister \u2013 Game of Thrones)\nTyrion Lannister (Game of Thrones)\nBryan Cranston (Walter White \u2013 Breaking Bad)\nFrank Underwood (House of Cards)\nTommy Shelby (Peaky Blinders)\n\nThe Equipment that I use:\nRecording Microphone: http://goo.gl/qGZCLT\nDSLR Camera: http://goo.gl/MPX4RC\nLens: http://goo.gl/7T7ZCH\nIntro Audio Mic: http://goo.gl/Azug4n\nRode Mic Stand: http://goo.gl/3IIgYW\nBOSE Headphones: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bose-QuietCo...",

In this video I take you through the different steps I took to begin my Alfie Solomons impression. Waiting patiently for season 5...\n\nArthus Shelby is one of the easier ones to from the Peaky Blinders tv show. Easier that Cillian Murphy's tommy shelby and Tom Hardy's Alfie Solomons anyway. get your brummy accents out for this one!\n\nPersonally looking forward to Season 5, thought they are really making us wait for that release date. I may actually go back and watch the whole thing again. Good tune up ready for the series being dropped. Will Alfie Return, John in a flashback?\n\nAnyone looking forward to Season 6? I quite enjoyed peaky blinders season 5, is peaky blinders season 5 on Netflix yet? If anyone knows of a season 6 trailer let me know! Has the cast started filming for season 6 yet? How will Tommy react to Oswald Mosley plan going tits up? bit of a blooper! Red right hand by nick cave, what a song! what a soundtrack! huzzah! maybe I should cover it, oh wait I already did!\n\nAs you guys know I\u2019m a big fan of Peaky Blinders, the cast, haircuts, whiskey, hair, outfits, hats, you name it, I like it. Thats why I do all the peaky blinder cast impressions (even the women!, Ada and Polly!), birmingham accent and all (or not in some cases). \n\nWill Tom Hardy come back as Alfie Solomons in the new season, season 6? no spoilers, and no fighting! I hope Aberama Gold is ok. He looked fine. Hopefully Finn and Michael grey disappear. The actors are fine, but the characters are so annoying! that would be some of the best moments of season 6 if that was the case.\n\nAre the peaky blinders real? I watched a video on it and the answer was sort of. and tommy quotes and edits, Tommy shelby, the real deal! The smoking 100 cigarettes a day real deal! let\u2019s hope he staves off death like a certain alfie solomons! He crosses the line that bloke! too often! c'ero vicino\nc'est quoi.\nDo you want some ASMR, most of their voices are pretty much ASMR. a s\u00e9rie\nPeaky Blinders won a bunch of awards recently, should I get some awards for my impressions impersonations and all round voices? Maybe if I dressed up they\u2019d give me the awards, behind the scenes and all that with cillian murphy and Tom hardy! Or maybe I\u2019ll just wait until season 6 of peaky blinders is on DVD.",

In this video I take you through the different steps I took to begin my Alfie Solomons impression. Waiting patiently for season 5...\n\nArthus Shelby is one of the easier ones to from the Peaky Blinders tv show. Easier that Cillian Murphy's tommy shelby and Tom Hardy's Alfie Solomons anyway. get your brummy accents out for this one!\n\nPersonally looking forward to Season 5, thought they are really making us wait for that release date. I may actually go back and watch the whole thing again. Good tune up ready for the series being dropped. Will Alfie Return, John in a flashback?\n\nAnyone looking forward to Season 6? I quite enjoyed peaky blinders season 5, is peaky blinders season 5 on Netflix yet? If anyone knows of a season 6 trailer let me know! Has the cast started filming for season 6 yet? How will Tommy react to Oswald Mosley plan going tits up? bit of a blooper! Red right hand by nick cave, what a song! what a soundtrack! huzzah! maybe I should cover it, oh wait I already did!\n\nAs you guys know I\u2019m a big fan of Peaky Blinders, the cast, haircuts, whiskey, hair, outfits, hats, you name it, I like it. Thats why I do all the peaky blinder cast impressions (even the women!, Ada and Polly!), birmingham accent and all (or not in some cases). \n\nWill Tom Hardy come back as Alfie Solomons in the new season, season 6? no spoilers, and no fighting! I hope Aberama Gold is ok. He looked fine. Hopefully Finn and Michael grey disappear. The actors are fine, but the characters are so annoying! that would be some of the best moments of season 6 if that was the case.\n\nAre the peaky blinders real? I watched a video on it and the answer was sort of. and tommy quotes and edits, Tommy shelby, the real deal! The smoking 100 cigarettes a day real deal! let\u2019s hope he staves off death like a certain alfie solomons! He crosses the line that bloke! too often! c'ero vicino\nc'est quoi.\nDo you want some ASMR, most of their voices are pretty much ASMR. a s\u00e9rie\nPeaky Blinders won a bunch of awards recently, should I get some awards for my impressions impersonations and all round voices? Maybe if I dressed up they\u2019d give me the awards, behind the scenes and all that with cillian murphy and Tom hardy! Or maybe I\u2019ll just wait until season 6 of peaky blinders is on DVD."

IN this video I take you through the different steps I took to begin my Alfie Solomons impression.\n\nCharlie Hopkinson is a comedic impressionist, impersonator, voice guy, whatever you want to call it who specialises in voices from current television shows and films. His standup is a character act about a retired maths teacher, his standup set includes impressions of Sir David Attenborough, Robin Williams, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Peaky Blinders, Tommy and Arthur Shelby and Gandalf from Lord of the Rings.\n\nAnyone looking forward to Season 6? I quite enjoyed peaky blinders season 5, is peaky blinders season 5 on Netflix yet? If anyone knows of a season 6 trailer let me know! Has the cast started filming for season 6 yet? How will Tommy react to Oswald Mosley plan going tits up? bit of a blooper! Red right hand by nick cave, what a song! what a soundtrack! huzzah! maybe I should cover it, oh wait I already did!\n\nAs you guys know I\u2019m a big fan of Peaky Blinders, the cast, haircuts, whiskey, hair, outfits, hats, you name it, I like it. Thats why I do all the peaky blinder cast impressions (even the women!, Ada and Polly!), birmingham accent and all (or not in some cases). \n\nWill Tom Hardy come back as Alfie Solomons in the new season, season 6? no spoilers, and no fighting! I hope Aberama Gold is ok. He looked fine. Hopefully Finn and Michael grey disappear. The actors are fine, but the characters are so annoying! that would be some of the best moments of season 6 if that was the case.\n\nAre the peaky blinders real? I watched a video on it and the answer was sort of. and tommy quotes and edits, Tommy shelby, the real deal! The smoking 100 cigarettes a day real deal! let\u2019s hope he staves off death like a certain alfie solomons! He crosses the line that bloke! too often! c'ero vicino\nc'est quoi.\nDo you want some ASMR, most of their voices are pretty much ASMR. a s\u00e9rie\nPeaky Blinders won a bunch of awards recently, should I get some awards for my impressions impersonations and all round voices? Maybe if I dressed up they\u2019d give me the awards, behind the scenes and all that with cillian murphy and Tom hardy! Or maybe I\u2019ll just wait until season 6 of peaky blinders is on DVD.\n\nHis top impressions include:\n\nMorgan Freeman (Red -Shawshank redemption)\nSir Ian McKellen (Gandalf \u2013 Lord of the Rings)\nAaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman \u2013 Breaking Bad)\nAlan Rickman (Snape \u2013 Harry Potter)\nMichael Caine (Alfred \u2013 Batman)\nJon Snow (Game of Thrones)\nJack Sparrow (Pirates of the Carribean)\nChristoph Waltz (Django Unchained, Inglorious bastards)\nAlec Guiness (Ben Kenobi \u2013 Star Wars)\nAgent Smith (The Matrix)\nSean Bean (Boromir \u2013 Lord of the Rings)\nRichard Armitage (Thorin Oakenshield \u2013 The Hobbit)\nCharles Dance (Tywin Lannister \u2013 Game of Thrones)\nTyrion Lannister (Game of Thrones)\nBryan Cranston (Walter White \u2013 Breaking Bad)\nFrank Underwood (House of Cards)\nTommy Shelby (Peaky Blinders)\n\nThe Equipment that I use:\nRecording Microphone: http://goo.gl/qGZCLT\nDSLR Camera: http://goo.gl/MPX4RC\nLens: http://goo.gl/7T7ZCH\nIntro Audio Mic: http://goo.gl/Azug4n\nRode Mic Stand: http://goo.gl/3IIgYW\nBOSE Headphones: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bose-QuietCo...",

                    "description": "How to get started on an Alfie Solomons impression...\nFull impressions course: https://skl.sh/3dmmGr6\n\nInstagram: charlie.hopkinson.4\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Voiceraptor\nSnapchat: chopkinson92\nBuy a Voicover: http://bit.ly/2QOBcLz\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/c_hopkinson\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=3213723\nMerchandise: shop.spreadshirt.co.uk/CharlieHopkinson\n\nHow to do an amazing Alfie Solomons impression in easy steps, a tutorial for beginners. IN this video I take you through the different steps I took to begin my Alfie Solomons impression.\n\nCharlie Hopkinson is a comedic impressionist, impersonator, voice guy, whatever you want to call it who specialises in voices from current television shows and films. His standup is a character act about a retired maths teacher, his standup set includes impressions of Sir David Attenborough, Robin Williams, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Peaky Blinders, Tommy and Arthur Shelby and Gandalf from Lord of the Rings.\n\nAnyone looking forward to Season 6? I quite enjoyed peaky blinders season 5, is peaky blinders season 5 on Netflix yet? If anyone knows of a season 6 trailer let me know! Has the cast started filming for season 6 yet? How will Tommy react to Oswald Mosley plan going tits up? bit of a blooper! Red right hand by nick cave, what a song! what a soundtrack! huzzah! maybe I should cover it, oh wait I already did!\n\nAs you guys know I\u2019m a big fan of Peaky Blinders, the cast, haircuts, whiskey, hair, outfits, hats, you name it, I like it. Thats why I do all the peaky blinder cast impressions (even the women!, Ada and Polly!), birmingham accent and all (or not in some cases). \n\nWill Tom Hardy come back as Alfie Solomons in the new season, season 6? no spoilers, and no fighting! I hope Aberama Gold is ok. He looked fine. Hopefully Finn and Michael grey disappear. The actors are fine, but the characters are so annoying! that would be some of the best moments of season 6 if that was the case.\n\nAre the peaky blinders real? I watched a video on it and the answer was sort of. and tommy quotes and edits, Tommy shelby, the real deal! The smoking 100 cigarettes a day real deal! let\u2019s hope he staves off death like a certain alfie solomons! He crosses the line that bloke! too often! c'ero vicino\nc'est quoi.\nDo you want some ASMR, most of their voices are pretty much ASMR. a s\u00e9rie\nPeaky Blinders won a bunch of awards recently, should I get some awards for my impressions impersonations and all round voices? Maybe if I dressed up they\u2019d give me the awards, behind the scenes and all that with cillian murphy and Tom hardy! Or maybe I\u2019ll just wait until season 6 of peaky blinders is on DVD.\n\nHis top impressions include:\n\nMorgan Freeman (Red -Shawshank redemption)\nSir Ian McKellen (Gandalf \u2013 Lord of the Rings)\nAaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman \u2013 Breaking Bad)\nAlan Rickman (Snape \u2013 Harry Potter)\nMichael Caine (Alfred \u2013 Batman)\nJon Snow (Game of Thrones)\nJack Sparrow (Pirates of the Carribean)\nChristoph Waltz (Django Unchained, Inglorious bastards)\nAlec Guiness (Ben Kenobi \u2013 Star Wars)\nAgent Smith (The Matrix)\nSean Bean (Boromir \u2013 Lord of the Rings)\nRichard Armitage (Thorin Oakenshield \u2013 The Hobbit)\nCharles Dance (Tywin Lannister \u2013 Game of Thrones)\nTyrion Lannister (Game of Thrones)\nBryan Cranston (Walter White \u2013 Breaking Bad)\nFrank Underwood (House of Cards)\nTommy Shelby (Peaky Blinders)\n\nThe Equipment that I use:\nRecording Microphone: http://goo.gl/qGZCLT\nDSLR Camera: http://goo.gl/MPX4RC\nLens: http://goo.gl/7T7ZCH\nIntro Audio Mic: http://goo.gl/Azug4n\nRode Mic Stand: http://goo.gl/3IIgYW\nBOSE Headphones: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bose-QuietCo..."
