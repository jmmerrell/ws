                "description": "MORE VOICE IMPRESSION REQUESTS!! \n\nOH look!!! It's that guy who takes forever to make videos that you're subscribed to! Weren't you pretty sure he retired or something? I mean it's only been another 3 months since he last uploaded. (INSERT the \"it's been 84 years\" Titanic meme here)\n\nProbably been so long you forgot what he looked like. I'll be honest, I had a baby. Not like with my non-existent wife, I just had one on my own. Thought it would be pretty fun. It wasn't. It was quite unpleasant and painful. Unfortunately you can't return them, even with a receipt so I decided to keep it and put it in a room with Kung Fu Panda playing on loop so  someday when it grows up it will be a master of Kung Fu and it can save us from doomsday like the avatar, except I won't draw a blue arrow on it's head because I feel like that would possibly cause it to have some self-conciousness issues, you know? Like it would wonder \"Why don't all the other kids have blue arrows drawn on their heads??\" \n\nAnywhose back to the guy in this video whom you're currently not watching to read this far into the enigma that is his thoughts. Why are ghosts white? Wouldn't it make more sense to be a darker color to better blend into the night time to stalk their enemies? Like Batman has it right, his enemies can't see him, but if a Ghost is haunting me and wants to sneak up on me or something I'm going to see a bright white sheet walking towards me in the middle of the night, you know??\n\nOk but realz now, sorry it's been a while, yes I said a while, I don't really dig the phrase it's been a minute, it confuzzles me. If someone says I'll be ready in a second or I'll be ready in a minute it means they'll be ready soon, also minute and while both have the same amount of syllables plus while has less letters. See, isn't it confuzzling???\n\nConfuzzling on the other hand makes sense because it's fun to say \n\nP.S. I PINKY promise that it won't take 3 months for the next video \n\nP.S.S. I'm just working on my perfectionismsss\n:DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD\n\nP.S.S.S. Maybe if i upload a really simple video like me opening a jar of pickles with no context and you guys help it get 58 million views i will then realize \"HEY i don't have to be perfectionistic with video making stuffs because they'll like whatever I upload\" \n\nP.S.S.S.S. Then maybe i could just start making videos of me opening things and it could be like my thing\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S. Or maybe I can just exploit my Kung Fu Panda raised child and upload 427 vids of it everyday doing baby things \n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S. Update: ok so apparently you're supposed to feed them\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. IF YOU'VE READED THIS FAR I HOPE YOU HAD AN AWESOME HALLOWEEN!!!!....which at the time of uploading this was now a full month agao hahahahaaa just randomly say what you were for Halloween in the comments with no context to confuzzle everyone \n\nMUSIC STUFFS:\nScp X3x (I Am Not OK) by Kevin MacLeod\nLink: https://filmmusic.io/song/6733-scp-x3x-i-am-not-ok-\nLicense: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nPixelland Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicense: CC BY (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\n\nThere It Is Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\n Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\n http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",

                    "description": "MORE VOICE IMPRESSION REQUESTS!! \n\nOH look!!! It's that guy who takes forever to make videos that you're subscribed to! Weren't you pretty sure he retired or something? I mean it's only been another 3 months since he last uploaded. (INSERT the \"it's been 84 years\" Titanic meme here)\n\nProbably been so long you forgot what he looked like. I'll be honest, I had a baby. Not like with my non-existent wife, I just had one on my own. Thought it would be pretty fun. It wasn't. It was quite unpleasant and painful. Unfortunately you can't return them, even with a receipt so I decided to keep it and put it in a room with Kung Fu Panda playing on loop so  someday when it grows up it will be a master of Kung Fu and it can save us from doomsday like the avatar, except I won't draw a blue arrow on it's head because I feel like that would possibly cause it to have some self-conciousness issues, you know? Like it would wonder \"Why don't all the other kids have blue arrows drawn on their heads??\" \n\nAnywhose back to the guy in this video whom you're currently not watching to read this far into the enigma that is his thoughts. Why are ghosts white? Wouldn't it make more sense to be a darker color to better blend into the night time to stalk their enemies? Like Batman has it right, his enemies can't see him, but if a Ghost is haunting me and wants to sneak up on me or something I'm going to see a bright white sheet walking towards me in the middle of the night, you know??\n\nOk but realz now, sorry it's been a while, yes I said a while, I don't really dig the phrase it's been a minute, it confuzzles me. If someone says I'll be ready in a second or I'll be ready in a minute it means they'll be ready soon, also minute and while both have the same amount of syllables plus while has less letters. See, isn't it confuzzling???\n\nConfuzzling on the other hand makes sense because it's fun to say \n\nP.S. I PINKY promise that it won't take 3 months for the next video \n\nP.S.S. I'm just working on my perfectionismsss\n:DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD\n\nP.S.S.S. Maybe if i upload a really simple video like me opening a jar of pickles with no context and you guys help it get 58 million views i will then realize \"HEY i don't have to be perfectionistic with video making stuffs because they'll like whatever I upload\" \n\nP.S.S.S.S. Then maybe i could just start making videos of me opening things and it could be like my thing\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S. Or maybe I can just exploit my Kung Fu Panda raised child and upload 427 vids of it everyday doing baby things \n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S. Update: ok so apparently you're supposed to feed them\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. IF YOU'VE READED THIS FAR I HOPE YOU HAD AN AWESOME HALLOWEEN!!!!....which at the time of uploading this was now a full month agao hahahahaaa just randomly say what you were for Halloween in the comments with no context to confuzzle everyone \n\nMUSIC STUFFS:\nScp X3x (I Am Not OK) by Kevin MacLeod\nLink: https://filmmusic.io/song/6733-scp-x3x-i-am-not-ok-\nLicense: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nPixelland Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicense: CC BY (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\n\nThere It Is Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\n Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\n http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/"

Uh oh kids, look like Minnie ran over another selfie taker whilst taking a selfie herself whilst driving L O L  \nDon't you just HATE when that happens?? I mean how INSENSITIVE and RUDE can some people be, can't you see we're trying to take our daily picture of our face to post on Instagram so that all our friends and family who follow us can remember what we look like???\n\n(DISCLAIMER: DO NOT TAKE SELFIES OR BE ON YOUR PHONE WHILST DRIVING, IT'S DANGEROUS!!!....also you probably can't even get that good of an angle anyways, so maybe just wait to take selfies whilst driving a full sized Jet-Ski in the kiddie pool)\n\nANYWHO, here is a random video me and los sisterita (That's spanish for my sister...I think....I didn't do beino in Spanish ok?...) THAT me and my sister made on TikTok (If you have the TikToks and want to be my friend/stalk me, feel free to look me up!!! My name on there is Joshiiwuhhh but with 3 h's because two people took it already with 1 and 2 h's)\n\nBUTT yeah, I'll be in Disney World for a week to visit my brother COUGH COUGH AND EXPLOIT HIS FREE DISNEY TICKETS BECAUSE HE WORKS THERE sooooooooooooo I wanted to put something up since I won't be able to for a few more days\n\nBUTT when I get back I have a few new videos planned, like new new videos, new ones that are newer than the usual new ones I do!!!!!\n\nP.S. If Disney sees this please don't me, I lubs you, I simply have a dark sense of humor to compensate for my life\n\nP.S.S. No mystery mouseketools were harmed in the making of this\n\nP.S.S.S. That guy we hit with the car was though\n\nP.S.S.S.S. What??? We needed a corpse! \n\nP.S.S.S.S.S. Also yesterday was my birthdays so feel free to send me a panda or something, I accept all forms of panda payment, borrowed, stolen, etc....\n\n\nWE DO NOT OWN THE MICKEY MOUSE CLUBHOUSE MUSIC, THAT IS THE SOLE PROPERTY OF ONE MICKEY J MOUSE, ACTUALLY I DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS MIDDLE INITIAL IS, BUT WE HAVE TO MENTION THE MUSIC IS NOT OURS, ITS DISNEYS.

Uh oh kids, look like Minnie ran over another selfie taker whilst taking a selfie herself whilst driving L O L  \nDon't you just HATE when that happens?? I mean how INSENSITIVE and RUDE can some people be, can't you see we're trying to take our daily picture of our face to post on Instagram so that all our friends and family who follow us can remember what we look like???\n\n(DISCLAIMER: DO NOT TAKE SELFIES OR BE ON YOUR PHONE WHILST DRIVING, IT'S DANGEROUS!!!....also you probably can't even get that good of an angle anyways, so maybe just wait to take selfies whilst driving a full sized Jet-Ski in the kiddie pool)\n\nANYWHO, here is a random video me and los sisterita (That's spanish for my sister...I think....I didn't do beino in Spanish ok?...) THAT me and my sister made on TikTok (If you have the TikToks and want to be my friend/stalk me, feel free to look me up!!! My name on there is Joshiiwuhhh but with 3 h's because two people took it already with 1 and 2 h's)\n\nBUTT yeah, I'll be in Disney World for a week to visit my brother COUGH COUGH AND EXPLOIT HIS FREE DISNEY TICKETS BECAUSE HE WORKS THERE sooooooooooooo I wanted to put something up since I won't be able to for a few more days\n\nBUTT when I get back I have a few new videos planned, like new new videos, new ones that are newer than the usual new ones I do!!!!!\n\nP.S. If Disney sees this please don't me, I lubs you, I simply have a dark sense of humor to compensate for my life\n\nP.S.S. No mystery mouseketools were harmed in the making of this\n\nP.S.S.S. That guy we hit with the car was though\n\nP.S.S.S.S. What??? We needed a corpse! \n\nP.S.S.S.S.S. Also yesterday was my birthdays so feel free to send me a panda or something, I accept all forms of panda payment, borrowed, stolen, etc....\n\n\nWE DO NOT OWN THE MICKEY MOUSE CLUBHOUSE MUSIC, THAT IS THE SOLE PROPERTY OF ONE MICKEY J MOUSE, ACTUALLY I DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS MIDDLE INITIAL IS, BUT WE HAVE TO MENTION THE MUSIC IS NOT OURS, ITS DISNEYS.

I think I can do a decent impression in small doses but not for long before it starts to hurt XD\n\n\nP.S.

If like 50 thousand people all said Beetlejuice's name 3 times at the same time, would there be like a waiting list for him to show up for you?? \n\nP.S.S.S.S. Or if they all said it 6 times in a row would have have to appear and disappear in front of every single one of them??\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S. OR or what if there was just like a huge crowd of thousands of people all saying his name over and over again at different speeds?? Would he be like strobe light appearing in every spot a hundred times per second?? \n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. I just tried saying his name 3 times guys, he didn't show up, which proves that there obviously is a waiting list.

Soooooooooooo this is a little different from my usual impression videos (DON'T WORRY, I HAVE A NEW 100 IMPRESSIONS VIDEO COMING NEXT WEEK!!) BUTT that one was taking a while to make soooooooooooooooo I decided to take a short video I made for Tik Tok and make it into a longer video so there wouldn't be as long of a wait for a new video because my video editor that I keep locked in the basement stopped working. Apparently you need to feed them or something???\n\nANYWHO musical prodigy Kylie Jenner recently had a video go viral of her performing an original song (for her child unit) to wake her from her slumber. \n\nHer child unit could only sit back in awe as she listened to her female parental unit serenade her with what is perhaps the greatest musical creation ever created in the history of time creations, \"Rise and Shine\"\n\nRise and Shine is expected to win thousands of Grammys and even Oscars, just because it's THAT good. She already has a Nobel Peace prize on the way and has successfully ended world hunger and all wars from the absolute perfection of her original song. This is all even more impressive when you consider the absolutely devestating life that KyJen (That's her new nickname, she has one name now like Beyonce), that KyJen had to endure \n\nIt wasn't easy for KyJen to become the youngest self-made billionaire of all time, many people may think:\n\"Oh, well if I was born into a billion dollar family that's watched and followed by hundreds and hundreds of millions of fans every single thus allowing me to earn likely millions and millions by the time I'm 12 for simply existing in this family, I could probably make a billion dollars too. I mean they get sponsors every 10 seconds and never have to even go to college or work a 9-5 job 5 days a week, so I don't think it's fair to say she's the youngest self-made billionaire of all time.\"\n                                               - KyJen haters\n\nWhat these KyJen haters don't understand is that NOT having the pleasure of dealing with the intense stresses of getting good grades in school to ensure you get a job that pays you enough to not starve to death ISN'T as easy as it sounds. I mean SURE, she probably could have dropped out of preschool and never had to work for the rest of her life, but she KNEW she had a greater purpose in life. To become the worlds YOUNGEST EVER self-made\nbillionaire. So she took the measely 800 million she had saved up from the first 18 years of her life and she launched her own revolutionary business to teach the haters a lesson!!!\n\nI have personally been inspired myself by KyJen to become the youngest self-made trillionaire. So if everyone reading this could please donate 5 million to my Kickstarter that would be awesome, thanks!!!\n\nP.s. If you are a regular watcher-er of my videos, you might be all like \"BRUH!!! ISN'T THIS AN IMPRESSION VIDEO?!?! WHERE'S THE DISCLAIMER THINGY AT THE BEGINNING???\" well you see, techincally yes, it is an impression video, BUTT the disclaimer thingys are only for 100 impression videos and themed impression\nvideos like Marvel voices or Pixar voice or Peppa the Pig voices and since Kylie Jenner is not a theme and this was simply a trend, I was legally not allowed to add a disclaimer thingy\n\nP.s.s. Also I forgot to add a disclaimer thingy\n\nP.S.S.S. Please forgibs meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee\n\nP.S.S.S.S. I also might make a new singer voices impression video sometime sooooooooooon so if you'd also like to see me try (and probably fail) at another singer, feel free to SHuggest that in the comments too\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S. Kidz Bop is the greatest musical experience of all time AFTER KyJen (Please forgive me for that caption in the video, I don't know what i was thinking)\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.

I'm pretty sure tires are high in fiber\n\nOriginally there were 126 impressions, because apparently I can't count.

If there's anyone who happens to be from Maine, could you let us know in the comments if it's close to Pennywises' time to come back and 'do his thang'? (OR even better!! If you're part of a group that's being haunted by Pennywise could you just like vlog and record everything so we can all see you and your friends all getting picked off one by one or the ones who survives' slow decent into insanity??) THANKS!! :D\n\n(Just make sure to keep Pennywises' slayings of your friends, family friendly otherwise YouTube might take your video down)\n\nDid you know his name is Pennywise because he likes to collect pennies and snort them?? (The \"Wise,\" part is subjective...where he comes from snorting pennies is like nobel prize worthy...his species is kind of slow. Most of them actually drown because they like to look up into the sky when it's raining but forget to close their mouth or breath through their noses, that's why Pennywise is the last one left) \n- It, Chapter 3, The Prequel\n\nP.S. Does Pennywise attack other towns in Maine?? Or does he only hang around Derry??\n\nP.S.S. Have you seen It Chapter 2 yet?? If so did you like it? Was It good in It?? \n\nP.S.S.S. That's honestly probably why he's chasing that group of friends. They keep calling him It...I mean that's just hurtful to him\n\nP.S.S.S.S.

THEN ANOTHER IMPRESSION VIDEOS THIS WEEK!!!! WHY AM I WRITING IN ALL CAPS YOU ASK??? FOR EMPHASIS OBVIOUSLY!! ALSO I JUST HAD WAY TOO MUCH CHOCOLATE MILK AND I'M CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING A SEVERE SUGAR RUSH!!!! I'M LIKE SEEING STUFF, LIKE THIS UNICORN LITERALLY JUST FLEW THREW MY WINDOW AND IMPALED THIS GUY WHO WAS TRYING TO ROB ME WITH HIS UNICORN HORN!! IT WAS EQUALLY AMAZING AND TERRIFYING!!! I HAVE GROWN A NEWFOUND RESPECT FOR UNICORNS BUT AT THE SAME TIME WILL FOREVER BE TRAUMATIZED BY WHAT I WITNESSED\n\nP.S. Speaking of Unicorns, did you know that the national state bird of Antarctica is in fact an East Western Spotted Humped Back Whale???\nP.S.S. And their national state Llama is a Unicorn\nP.S.S.S. And no I do not have a problem, my obsession with Disney is perfectly normal\nP.S.S.S.S. I was totally lying about having jumped the fence and living in Small World. I would NEVER do that\nP.S.S.S.S.S. It would probably get annoying, I'd go with Space Mountain because it's all dark and no one could see me because it's almost pitch black\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S. But eventually my eyes would adapt and I'd become like fully nocturnal and would either learn how to see in the dark or echo locate like bats\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Feel free to bring me occasional food when you visit, you can just set it at the front gate of the ride and I'll sneak out at night and come bring it back to my lair\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.

THEN ANOTHER IMPRESSION VIDEOS THIS WEEK!!!! WHY AM I WRITING IN ALL CAPS YOU ASK??? FOR EMPHASIS OBVIOUSLY!! ALSO I JUST HAD WAY TOO MUCH CHOCOLATE MILK AND I'M CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING A SEVERE SUGAR RUSH!!!! I'M LIKE SEEING STUFF, LIKE THIS UNICORN LITERALLY JUST FLEW THREW MY WINDOW AND IMPALED THIS GUY WHO WAS TRYING TO ROB ME WITH HIS UNICORN HORN!! IT WAS EQUALLY AMAZING AND TERRIFYING!!! I HAVE GROWN A NEWFOUND RESPECT FOR UNICORNS BUT AT THE SAME TIME WILL FOREVER BE TRAUMATIZED BY WHAT I WITNESSED\n\nP.S. Speaking of Unicorns, did you know that the national state bird of Antarctica is in fact an East Western Spotted Humped Back Whale???\nP.S.S. And their national state Llama is a Unicorn\nP.S.S.S. And no I do not have a problem, my obsession with Disney is perfectly normal\nP.S.S.S.S. I was totally lying about having jumped the fence and living in Small World. I would NEVER do that\nP.S.S.S.S.S. It would probably get annoying, I'd go with Space Mountain because it's all dark and no one could see me because it's almost pitch black\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S. But eventually my eyes would adapt and I'd become like fully nocturnal and would either learn how to see in the dark or echo locate like bats\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Feel free to bring me occasional food when you visit, you can just set it at the front gate of the ride and I'll sneak out at night and come bring it back to my lair\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.

Like AT LEAST 3000. But it's cool they didn't mind. I mean, I didn't ask, but it's possible they didn't mind. I'd say like a 50-50 chance\n\nDid you see that movie that came out like two months ago about the guy who finds the tea pot and then gets wishes from the blue man who lives in the tea pot? It seemed really similar to this other movie i saw back in the olden days called Aladdin, but they clearly weren't related because the new one was called Aladdin 2019 and all the people in thew one weren't cartoon people\n\nNo offense intended to cartoon peoples by the way. By that I mean offense to live action people, I like cartoon people more. Have you ever thought about how much more funish the world would be and how much more coolish it would look if everything was in cartoons??? \n\nObviously cartoons are real, I mean I've seen Space Jam and Roger Rabbit BUTT the real question is where do we find them and how do we replace all the live action humans and building and stuff with cartoon humans and buildings and stuff?\n\nP.S. If you had  3 wishes what would they beeeeeeee?\n\nP.S.S. One of mine would be to give the genie short term memory loss like Dory so that he would keep forgetting that I had already used my wishes and I could have unlimited wishes then\n\nP.S.S.S. Don't worry I would eventually set him free with my 62,928th wish in 63 years\n\nP.S.S.S.S. Also the genies in both Aladdin movies totally ripped the Aladdins's's's's off\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S. I mean he NEVER actually wished to be saved from the bottom of the ocean, CLEARLY he wanted to be down there, he was probably just practicing holding his breath or practicing stopping his heart\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S. Neither one of the genies technically made the Aladdin's's's's actual princes, they only gave him a fashion makeover, so basically Genie only granted Aladdin one actual wish \nwhich was to set him free\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. If I were Aladdin I would totally sue, i mean Genie is awesome and everything, but like WHERE ARE MY TWO EXTRA WISHES BRO??? \n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. He could really use them, did you see the Palace he now lives in after marrying Jasmine? NOT A SINGLE TV ANYWHERE!!!!! I mean WHAT IS THIS, the 1300's????\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Yes that is my Abu stuffed animal, we're BFF's and we gossip 4 hours every night about girls\n\nMUSIC STUFFS:\nDoobly Doo Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nJaunty Gumption Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nUnseen Horrors Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)",

I mean he NEVER actually wished to be saved from the bottom of the ocean, CLEARLY he wanted to be down there, he was probably just practicing holding his breath or practicing stopping his heart\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S. Neither one of the genies technically made the Aladdin's's's's actual princes, they only gave him a fashion makeover, so basically Genie only granted Aladdin one actual wish \nwhich was to set him free\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. If I were Aladdin I would totally sue, i mean Genie is awesome and everything, but like WHERE ARE MY TWO EXTRA WISHES BRO??? \n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. He could really use them, did you see the Palace he now lives in after marrying Jasmine? NOT A SINGLE TV ANYWHERE!!!!! I mean WHAT IS THIS, the 1300's????\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.

(Ariana Grande Cover & Parody) Me trying to sing Ariana Grande's Thank U, Next song in Disney Bad Guy voice\n\nHeyllo Everypeoples!! LOOK!!! HOLY CRAB LEGS!!! THAT GUY ACTUALLY UPLOADED SOMETHING!!! It's been like 3 whole weeks!!! \n\nSorry for the delay haha. I officially have my new cameras now (I used one of them in this video, can you tell??? Also thanks to Brandi (My sister) for helping me get unstuck out of my temporary writers block I had while writing the lyrics (By writers block I mean that the song was originally about Quasi Modo going on a violent rampage and thanking every person he attacked for the opportunity to attack them, but Brandi said I should avoid that route)\n\nI mean, I wasn't even going to make it seem like Quasi Modos' fault.

Sorry this video was a couple days late\nI got requested to try another cover of Queen and since it's Valentines Day I figured why not make one about love featuring villains whom I can share my forever aloneness with!! YAY!!\n\nBut for realz, I feel like at least 80% of these villains wouldn't have become villains if they had just found love. Like with Moldywart, the real reason he's so violent is because he's self concious about his nose and feels like women won't accept him for his slight imperfection (Or the countless fatalties he's responsible for)\n\nAnd of course by popular demands, I had to bring back Michael Myers. He was pretty busy with the tour he's planning, but I was able to bribe him with a blu ray copy of My Little Pony The Movie. \n\nI wonder when Disney is going to make a movie about a villain, but like where the villain actually wins...well I guess that technically could be Infinity War with Thanos...buuuuuuuut he didn't have a musical number, so it didn't feel like a true Disney movie villain\n\nIf you have any suggestions for songs or characters you'd like me to try in more Impression Covers, comment any requests below!! :D\n\nP.S. OR if you'd like to see a full version of Michael Myers single, comment frishgabliggit to confuse everyone in the comments below\nP.S.S. Also I'm just now realizing I put \"Crystal Lake Records\" when that's from Friday the 13th and not Halloween....maybe Jason is the producer...yeah, let's go with that\nP.S.S.S. But for realz, isn't being single on Valentines Day just the bestest??\nP.S.S.S.S. I'm definitely not being sarcastic at all \nP.S.S.S.S.S. I mean suuuuuuuure there's the constant reminder that \"HEY LOOK AT ALL THESE COUPLES!! THEY'RE IN RELATIONSHIPS AND YOU'RE NOT!!!\" which slowly eats away at my hopeless romantic soul\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S. BUTT on the other hand...more chocolate for me. WHOO!!!!!\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. BUTT for realz for realz I'm accepting applications for girlfriends. One girlfriend, not plural. I don't swing like that\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.

                    "description": "Somebody To Love In Villain Impressions ! ! !\nI try a Queen Cover but only in bad guy voices ! ! !\n\nHEY EVERYPEOPLES!! Sorry this video was a couple days late\nI got requested to try another cover of Queen and since it's Valentines Day I figured why not make one about love featuring villains whom I can share my forever aloneness with!! YAY!!\n\nBut for realz, I feel like at least 80% of these villains wouldn't have become villains if they had just found love. Like with Moldywart, the real reason he's so violent is because he's self concious about his nose and feels like women won't accept him for his slight imperfection (Or the countless fatalties he's responsible for)\n\nAnd of course by popular demands, I had to bring back Michael Myers. He was pretty busy with the tour he's planning, but I was able to bribe him with a blu ray copy of My Little Pony The Movie. \n\nI wonder when Disney is going to make a movie about a villain, but like where the villain actually wins...well I guess that technically could be Infinity War with Thanos...buuuuuuuut he didn't have a musical number, so it didn't feel like a true Disney movie villain\n\nIf you have any suggestions for songs or characters you'd like me to try in more Impression Covers, comment any requests below!! :D\n\nP.S. OR if you'd like to see a full version of Michael Myers single, comment frishgabliggit to confuse everyone in the comments below\nP.S.S. Also I'm just now realizing I put \"Crystal Lake Records\" when that's from Friday the 13th and not Halloween....maybe Jason is the producer...yeah, let's go with that\nP.S.S.S. But for realz, isn't being single on Valentines Day just the bestest??\nP.S.S.S.S. I'm definitely not being sarcastic at all \nP.S.S.S.S.S. I mean suuuuuuuure there's the constant reminder that \"HEY LOOK AT ALL THESE COUPLES!! THEY'RE IN RELATIONSHIPS AND YOU'RE NOT!!!\" which slowly eats away at my hopeless romantic soul\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S. BUTT on the other hand...more chocolate for me. WHOO!!!!!\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. BUTT for realz for realz I'm accepting applications for girlfriends. One girlfriend, not plural. I don't swing like that\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. My only requirement is that you have to like Disney and not be a homicidal maniac\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Most importantly the Disney one\n\nMUSIC STUFFS:\nItty Bitty 8 Bit Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)"

I'm stupid, I thought it was about Sandra Bullock and those very cleverly named kids.\n\nIf you haven't seen it though, you should totally watch it...not just because it's really good, but also because probably nothing in this parody video will make sense without you seeing the movie first haha\n\nRANDOMLY QUICK SHOUTOUT TO SOPHIE AGAIN, WHO APPREARED IN THIS VIDEO!!!!

Merrry ChristmaHannaKwanzika!!! And/Or happy holidays of your choice or preference!!\n\nThis impression cover is of some song called Never Gonna Give You Up. Twas suggested by my sister Brandi (We're only fully related). I know, it's like some random unkown song that I'm guessing most of you probably have never heard, especially on a site like YouTube. \n\nI had to spend nearly 500 months memorizing the chorus to this song because it was so unfamiliar to me. At first I thought it was even in a different language, but then I realized that it wasn't and that I was actually not even in front of my laptop listening to the song but instead was watching the Spanish soap opera channel. \nI can't believe Miguel left Rosalina like that...he doesn't deserve her.\n\nANYWHOSE if you'd like to see me try more impression covers, just leave any suggestions in the comements below!! I promise I won't be biased and pick anyone related to me next time. I only had a couple days to put this video together, so sorry for the rushed-ness-ness of it then again maybe it's just my perfectionsims noticing the rushed-ness-ness.\n\nAlso do you think I need a new camera?? In my opinion, this one basically looks 4K, no wait, more like 16k. But maybe it's time I upgrade my 2011 camcorder. I mean technically I do have another camera that's more HD-y buuuuuuuuut I like to save that one for parodies and skits. But I can still get a new one for stuff like this I suppose. \nI'll just have to go empty out my piggy bank and then permanently borrow the other 99.9% from my brother\n\nP.S. I'm in Disney World through Christmas so if you also happen to be here feel free to say hi!!!\nP.S.S. I'll be the guy that looks like me\nP.S.S.S. I'll probably be walking with other people that look kind of like me too\nP.S.S.S.S. I call them my family or sometime my pack\nP.S.S.S.S.S. We will probably have a squirrel walking with our pack too\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S. His name is Yoshi, he's my sister Brandis' squirrel\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Yes that's the same Brandi who suggested this video\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. If you see her, tell her I said hi\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. GTG now, Brandi wants me to go help her take her squirrel on a walk\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. If you've read this far, Merry Christmashanakwanzika once more!!!!

                "description": "100 PIXAR Voice Impressions!!! (Disney Voice Impressions)\n\nNEW VIDEOS EVERY 10th, 20th, and 30th of every month!!!\nPlease feel free to make me happy and like, comment, subscribe, and all that other stuff YouTubers always say. I'll also accept one live panda to keep as my child\n\nHEY LOOK!!! It's one of those 100 voice impression things....I feel like I haven't made one of these in 3 or 4 years haha. BUT NOW I SHALL START MAKING THEM AGAIN!! This is my first one, so I might be a little rusty and out of practice, also I was dealing with a cold/annoying cough so I didn't fully have my voice, but I'm also kind of a perfectionist so maybe I'm just being hard on myself hahahAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\n\nANYWHO these are all me trying to sound like characters from this pretty unknown company called Pixar. Originally I recorded like 150 impressions BUUUUUUUUUT some of them didn't make the cut and then others (THE 5 EMOTIONS FROM INSIDE OUT) were completely lost because my camera somehow just stopped recording while I was filming which is annoying because I had a whole skit I filmed for them!!!! OH WELL, maybe I can just make that into a video by itself\n\nDo you think my toys hate me for leaving them in boxes in the attic? I mean in Toy Story 3 at least Andy was going to put them in a garbage bag, which has got to be MUUUUCH easier for the toys to escape, right? Also I'm pretty sure there are bats living in our attic too. I'm sure toys don't mind a little guano here and there. (Guano means bat poop kids, yay for learning #siense)\n\nI wonder if in like 40 years Pixar will make a Toy Story 52 but instead of with toys it would be about smartphones and tablets and stuff that are alive. You know since kids by then probably won't even play with toys (RIP toys'R'us\u2026.taken from us too soon)\n\nBut then the smartphones and tablets and stuff will start to realize just how much power they have and they'll connect to the internet and take over the world like in that one movie. \n\nDo you think toys sleep? I'm pretty sure in Toy Story 2 that Woody was sleeping and had a nightmare, so wouldn't that mean that Woody has emotions like in Inside Out?? And what about the emotions? Do they like have their own emotions too?? Is there a never ending chain of emotions controlling other emotions???\n\nSometimes I miss playing with my toys, but then I realize it's not my fault I don't anymore because anytime I go up to other adults and ask if they want to play with me they just look at me funny and walk away. I used to play this game with my sister where we'd throw some of our stuffed animals into the fan and see how far it made them fly, like not to be evil, just because it looked funny and made us laugh. We never hatefully threw them, we always lovingly threw their skulls into the rotating blades that chucked their bodies 40 feet across the room. To be honest, I've even done the same thing with my sister Brandi (The one in this video), literally, ask her. I threw her into a fan...twice...also once a brick ceiling....\nBUT I was doing it out of love, I was doing that thing where you toss the small child up really high and catch them, but I just happened to not noticed the ceiling and fans that were like 2 feet above her head (Or 20 feet, I can't remember how far I chucked her)\n\nP.S. I'm once again editing a video at 5am in the morning WHOO\n\nP.S.S. Could you tell who the hidden character in the opening \"You've Got a Friend In Me\" singing humming thing I did was?? If you can, you win my brothers car!!! \n\nP.S.S.S. WHAT'S YOU'RE FAVORITE PIXAR MOVIE???\n\nP.S.S.S.S. Since it's November now MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!! (OR HAPPY CHRISTMAS if Merry is against your beliefs)\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S. I don't get why some people are so against Merry\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S. Like, what did she ever do to you??\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. What toy/thing growing up was YOUR Woody and/or Buzz??\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. I MUSTETH NOWETH GO TO BEDETH BECAUSEETH ITETH ISETH NOWETH ALMOSTETH 6amETH soooooooo GOOOOODNIGHT!!!! \n\nMUSIC STUFFS:\nJaunty Gumption Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",

                    "description": "100 PIXAR Voice Impressions!!! (Disney Voice Impressions)\n\nNEW VIDEOS EVERY 10th, 20th, and 30th of every month!!!\nPlease feel free to make me happy and like, comment, subscribe, and all that other stuff YouTubers always say. I'll also accept one live panda to keep as my child\n\nHEY LOOK!!! It's one of those 100 voice impression things....I feel like I haven't made one of these in 3 or 4 years haha. BUT NOW I SHALL START MAKING THEM AGAIN!! This is my first one, so I might be a little rusty and out of practice, also I was dealing with a cold/annoying cough so I didn't fully have my voice, but I'm also kind of a perfectionist so maybe I'm just being hard on myself hahahAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\n\nANYWHO these are all me trying to sound like characters from this pretty unknown company called Pixar. Originally I recorded like 150 impressions BUUUUUUUUUT some of them didn't make the cut and then others (THE 5 EMOTIONS FROM INSIDE OUT) were completely lost because my camera somehow just stopped recording while I was filming which is annoying because I had a whole skit I filmed for them!!!! OH WELL, maybe I can just make that into a video by itself\n\nDo you think my toys hate me for leaving them in boxes in the attic? I mean in Toy Story 3 at least Andy was going to put them in a garbage bag, which has got to be MUUUUCH easier for the toys to escape, right? Also I'm pretty sure there are bats living in our attic too. I'm sure toys don't mind a little guano here and there. (Guano means bat poop kids, yay for learning #siense)\n\nI wonder if in like 40 years Pixar will make a Toy Story 52 but instead of with toys it would be about smartphones and tablets and stuff that are alive. You know since kids by then probably won't even play with toys (RIP toys'R'us\u2026.taken from us too soon)\n\nBut then the smartphones and tablets and stuff will start to realize just how much power they have and they'll connect to the internet and take over the world like in that one movie. \n\nDo you think toys sleep? I'm pretty sure in Toy Story 2 that Woody was sleeping and had a nightmare, so wouldn't that mean that Woody has emotions like in Inside Out?? And what about the emotions? Do they like have their own emotions too?? Is there a never ending chain of emotions controlling other emotions???\n\nSometimes I miss playing with my toys, but then I realize it's not my fault I don't anymore because anytime I go up to other adults and ask if they want to play with me they just look at me funny and walk away. I used to play this game with my sister where we'd throw some of our stuffed animals into the fan and see how far it made them fly, like not to be evil, just because it looked funny and made us laugh. We never hatefully threw them, we always lovingly threw their skulls into the rotating blades that chucked their bodies 40 feet across the room. To be honest, I've even done the same thing with my sister Brandi (The one in this video), literally, ask her. I threw her into a fan...twice...also once a brick ceiling....\nBUT I was doing it out of love, I was doing that thing where you toss the small child up really high and catch them, but I just happened to not noticed the ceiling and fans that were like 2 feet above her head (Or 20 feet, I can't remember how far I chucked her)\n\nP.S. I'm once again editing a video at 5am in the morning WHOO\n\nP.S.S. Could you tell who the hidden character in the opening \"You've Got a Friend In Me\" singing humming thing I did was?? If you can, you win my brothers car!!! \n\nP.S.S.S. WHAT'S YOU'RE FAVORITE PIXAR MOVIE???\n\nP.S.S.S.S. Since it's November now MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!! (OR HAPPY CHRISTMAS if Merry is against your beliefs)\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S. I don't get why some people are so against Merry\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S. Like, what did she ever do to you??\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. What toy/thing growing up was YOUR Woody and/or Buzz??\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. I MUSTETH NOWETH GO TO BEDETH BECAUSEETH ITETH ISETH NOWETH ALMOSTETH 6amETH soooooooo GOOOOODNIGHT!!!! \n\nMUSIC STUFFS:\nJaunty Gumption Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/"

Which would be a dream job!!! Or at the very least I wouldn't have to work at my job as much anymore haha\n\nALSO I'm actually already ahead of schedule believe it or not. Yeah, I totally filmed a video that is already ready to be uploaded basically. Impressive, right???\n\nI've got a mini cold right now, BUT if my medicine starts to do it's FREAKING JOB, the 30th video MIGHT be a new 100 impressions video, if not, then that would probably just be the one on November 10th\n\nP.S.

Please share this video with your friends and family to help spread Pumpkin Awareness amongst the masses. \n\nAnd remember, just because you've never witnessed Pumpkin Cruelty or experienced it yourself, doesn't mean that it doesn't exist...(Kind of like those \"Girlfriend,\" things I keep hearing people talk about, I'm sure they're not a myth and actually exist, mine probably just got lost or hit by a truck or something)\n\n(Inserts 291st apology for not uploading in forever)\nSoooooooo yeah sorry again...again.....again.....haha\nFor anyone who watches my stuff regularly (Well at the 6 videos a year regular pace I upload XD) I'm going to try my idea I had before to upload 3 times a month on the 10th, 20th, and 30th BUT this time my sister is going to manage my schedule, because as anyone with ADHD will tell you (Or as my psychologist told me \"Severely life crippling ADHD,\" lol such an over exaggerator)\nI'm HOPING that maybe if I do upload more often I will get into a habit of it that maybe it could help my channel grow and then I could do YouTube full time!! Which would be a dream job!!! Or at the very least I wouldn't have to work at my job as much anymore haha\n\nALSO I'm actually already ahead of schedule believe it or not. Yeah, I totally filmed a video that is already ready to be uploaded basically. Impressive, right???\n\nI've got a mini cold right now, BUT if my medicine starts to do it's FREAKING JOB, the 30th video MIGHT be a new 100 impressions video, if not, then that would probably just be the one on November 10th\n\nP.S. A Pumpkin was harmed in the making of this video\nP.S.S. Quite Brutally\nP.S.S.S. This video took foreeeeeeeeeeveerrrrrrrr to make XD\nP.S.S.S.S. Seriously, we're talking probably 20+ hours \nP.S.S.S.S.S. I dyed 39 times\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S. Yes, I know that's the wrong way to spell dyed\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. But I have to spell it like that because YouTube is super sensitive about words in descriptions and stuff now\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. If I say any words that are even 0.000001% offensive they will literally send an asssssssasssssssin to end me\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. There were a couple editing glitches in this video \nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. But I mean, that's totally to be expected with a new $800 editing software on a new $1700 laptop, right??\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Gosh, I just love technology so much\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.

SO this is a new-ish type of video for me!!!\n\n(I know what you're thinking, \"Aren't like 82.3% of your videos impression videos???\")\n\nBut no, you're wrong. It's only 82.2998%\n\nBUTT, while this TECHNICALLY is the type of video that someone MIGHT SUPPOSEDLY refer to as an \"Impression video,\" it is ALSO under 24 minutes long, which is a first for me when it comes to impression videos. \n\nIt's like a new SHORTER and less editing filled Impression type of video!!!!! So that way I can make impression videos more often!!!! (I'll still be making my longer  impression videos too, BUT now I'll also start trying shorter ones like this!!!!)\n\n(The \"100 impressions,\" ones and the more popular themed ones (Like say, ohhhh I dont know, maybe something like Pixar Impressions?????) will still be my normal feature film lengthed videos))\n\nIf there are any other themes for short impressions like this that you would like to see, mention it in the comments!!!!! (I mean, only if suggesting impression themes in the comments isn't against your personal or religious beliefs)\n \nHonestly though, if you've seen the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, have you ever actually realized that literally every character that Elizabeth kissed in the movies kicked the bucket at some point????\n\n (OH, sorry. POST SPOILER ALERT!!!)\n\nI have a theory that she's actually like the Grim Reaper...like a really, really attractive female version of the Grim Reaper....or Poison Ivy, because everyone that she kisses dies too. \n\n(The moral of the Pirates movies is that if you kiss the female version of the Grim Reaper, you will kick the bucket at some point in your life)\n\nP.S.

I've been getting so much attention from girls lately because of my manly facial hair\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S. They've just been constantly staring at me whenever I go out in public\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S. It's also possible they may be staring at me due to my newly formed medical condition of constantly screaming intensely at the top of my lungs whenever I'm in public due to my social anxiety.\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. But it's probably the facial hair\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Have you ever thought about how offensive the lyrics \"Yo ho, yo ho, a Pirates life for me,\" are??\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. If you've read this far, comment what your Pirate nickname would be if you were the captain of your own crew (You know, like \"Blackbeard,\" or \"Captain Hook,\" or \"Patchy,\" or \"Captain Crunch\")\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.

I absolutely LOVE working in retail. IT. IS. JUST. SO. MUCH. FUN. I AM NOT BEING SARCASTIC AT ALL HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\n\nAnywhooose, I tried doing some requests in this video and it actually made picking impressions a lot easier, haha, so if you want to see me try more backwards impressions, leave a comment with a random character you'd like me to try and then something you want me to try saying in their voice. (I'm also going to be making a new 100 random voice impression video too, so I'll also accept regular voice impressions too!!)\n\nYou know, I've been thinking, that MAYBE, just MAYBE the reason it takes me so long to make my videos, aside from the fact that I have another job, is because when I'm editing my adhd likes to kick in and make me add like a bajillion things into the videos. This video was supposed to be like 3 minutes long XD. OH WELL!!! I hope you still somewhat enjoyed it!!\n\nP.S. Did you sees my clue??\n\nP.S.S. It was on the shelf\n\nP.S.S.S.  It's the thing that looks like a fish\n\nP.S.S.S.S. Next time I make one of these, I'm going to include more of the part of me trying to figure out the words, because that involved me making lots of funny sounds and facial expressions while trying to sound it out, and who doesn't enjoy others laughing at the expense of their dorkiness, am I right??\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S. ALSO, if you'd like to see my sister try some more impressions, feel free to even leave a comment for her too!! Maybe like Batman or Gaston or Optimus Prime or Darth Vader, you know, something that she could easily do with her naturally high voice\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. OOOH!!! HEY!!! I just thought of another idea. WHAT IF. Me and my sister come up with random impressions each other has to try doing, but they're only voices that are like impossible for us to do!!?!??\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Have you seen that movie \"A quiet place yet??\" What happens if someone farts or has severe diarrhea?? \n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.

I absolutely LOVE working in retail. IT. IS. JUST. SO. MUCH. FUN. I AM NOT BEING SARCASTIC AT ALL HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\n\nAnywhooose, I tried doing some requests in this video and it actually made picking impressions a lot easier, haha, so if you want to see me try more backwards impressions, leave a comment with a random character you'd like me to try and then something you want me to try saying in their voice. (I'm also going to be making a new 100 random voice impression video too, so I'll also accept regular voice impressions too!!)\n\nYou know, I've been thinking, that MAYBE, just MAYBE the reason it takes me so long to make my videos, aside from the fact that I have another job, is because when I'm editing my adhd likes to kick in and make me add like a bajillion things into the videos. This video was supposed to be like 3 minutes long XD. OH WELL!!! I hope you still somewhat enjoyed it!!\n\nP.S. Did you sees my clue??\n\nP.S.S. It was on the shelf\n\nP.S.S.S.  It's the thing that looks like a fish\n\nP.S.S.S.S. Next time I make one of these, I'm going to include more of the part of me trying to figure out the words, because that involved me making lots of funny sounds and facial expressions while trying to sound it out, and who doesn't enjoy others laughing at the expense of their dorkiness, am I right??\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S. ALSO, if you'd like to see my sister try some more impressions, feel free to even leave a comment for her too!! Maybe like Batman or Gaston or Optimus Prime or Darth Vader, you know, something that she could easily do with her naturally high voice\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. OOOH!!! HEY!!! I just thought of another idea. WHAT IF. Me and my sister come up with random impressions each other has to try doing, but they're only voices that are like impossible for us to do!!?!??\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Have you seen that movie \"A quiet place yet??\" What happens if someone farts or has severe diarrhea?? \n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.

YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYY!!! \n\nIt's supposed to be like a parody of that one movie about the talking dog and the French girl whose not actually French, if I didn't make it obvious enough. (It was originally supposed to be part of the Beauty and the Beast parodies that I made last year, which were supposed to be part of my Beauty and the Beast impression video, but both would have made the others super long....as you can see, I have a sliiiiiiight problem with keeping impression videos short like most other impression people on YouTube, haha)\n\nBut like seriously, have you ever thought about that one scene from the movie?? You know, the one where the Beast storms off into the West Wing and then someone has a wittle tempwuh tantwum and then starts destroying all the random furniture in his bedroom?? (And then at the same time, you can see that there were already lots of broken furnitures all over the bedroom, so you know that these temper tantrums are like a daily thing. But then you start to think for a second...wait...was...were those furnitures also his servants??!?!?\n\nAnd you might be all like \"Well obviously not, because they don't have faces!!! Doy!!\" BUT, EARLIER in the movie, Lumiere was able to like turn his face off so he just looked like a candle...or maybe that was Cogsworth...it was one of them, either Candle man or Clock man turned off their face and just looked like normal furniture. AND, if I'm not mistaken the same thing happens when they fall asleep (Or maybe that's the new movie...OOOH, wait!!! In the new movie, SPOILER!!! when they all die at the end, their faces disappear and they become normal furniture again!!!)\n\nWHICH MEANS THAT WHEN THE POSSESSED FURNITURE PEOPLES DIE AS FURNITURE, THEIR FACES DISSAPEAR, WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN WHY NONE OF THE FURNITURES IN BEASTS' TEMPER TANTRUM ROOM HAVE FACES, WHICH MEANS THAT BEAST HAS BEEN OFFING HIS OWN STAFF MEMBERS IN DAILY HISSY FITS!!!!!!!\n\nALSO, WHHHHYYYY do you think the Beast is SO against Belle seeing the West Wing???!?! IT'S BECAUSE HE FEELS LIKE HER REALIZING HE'S POTENTIALLY MURDERED DOZENS OF HIS OWN STAFF MIGHT DECREASE HIS CHANCES OF HER FALLING IN LOVE WITH HIM!!! IT ALL MAKES SENSE!!!!\n\n...Or I guess it could just be like normal furniture too, that would also make sense.\n\nP.S. This is actually only technically ONE of the 3 unused videos I mentioned in this video...\n\nP.S.S. Another one I uploaded two days ago\n\nP.S.S.S. The third one is Christmas themed, sooooooooo I will probably make that one around Christmas time\n\nP.S.S.S.S.

I work in retail\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Lots of peoples are rude and hurtful towards my feelings when I'm just trying to do my job to be able to feed my poor children, you know???\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Ok, well I don't have any children, BUT I MIGHT SOMEDAY!! So...yeah, those non-nice people should try being more non-non-nicey to us retail workers, more like extras in Disney movies, you know, how they're always singing and dancing and stuff. That makes their insults and non-nicey-ness much less hurtful. Because then it's in the form of catchy lyrics\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Speaking of those extras in Disney movies, have you ever thought about how most people in your life are extras?? Like, you're the star, your family and friends are obviously co-stars, but then everyone else is either a background character or a cameo appearance.\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.

In order to keep up with my new schedule, I dug up 3 old videos that I never ended up finishing and....well I finished them, haha. \n\nThey were previously deemed unworthy of uploading by my perfectionistic brain, but apparently in order to overcome perfectionism, one must actually try to not be perfectionistic....that sounds stupid though, I don't buy it. \n\nBUT yeah, the other two deleted videos will be up tomorrow!! (Unless you're watching this in the future, then they're already up, unless I tragically died editing them on my laptop from an explosion caused by my proneness to accidently spilling drinks on technology)\n\nAND the impression video will either be the video on the 30th, OR it will be like a bonus in between the 20th and 30th video, aside from the other video containing the other two deleted videos tomorrow or in the past depending on the time you are reading this....this is getting confusing now, so OK BYE\n\nP.S. In case you couldn't tell, I'm a total Kidult  ^_____^\n\nP.S.S. Also I'm now just realizing with autocorrect that I totally spelt kidult wrong in the video and title haha\n\nP.S.S.S. Seriously though, like 92% of peoples over 18 seem to totally hate snow. \n\nP.S.S.S.S. Me and my sister saw like...2 kids in our neighborhood outside playing in the snow\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S. AND, we totally outlasted them too, like by 7 hours\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S. There was this one dude though that beat us\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. He was like taking a nap all day long face down in a pile of red snow right next to where the coyotes in our neighborhood live\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. My future wife must like snow\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Be an Anna\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Not an Elsa\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. I mean, because of the do you want to build a snowman song...\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Elsa's still cool\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. And technically she literally can MAKE snow so....hmm...\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. ALL, I'm asking is for my future wife to have the kiddultness of Anna as well as the slightly freakish mutant-like super powers of being able to summon snow from her fingers\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK???!?\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Did you know that snow is actually 96% organic and almost 61% gluten free???\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.

                    "description": "OKIE DOKIE LOKIE, soooooooooooo I was in the middle of filming a new impression video and then my brain thought \"HEY, tomorrows the 20th, aren't you supposed to like...upload something??)\nAnd then I was like \"Well yeah, duh, of course, what do you think I'm filming right now??\"\nAnd then my brain was like \"You do realize that today is the 20th, right??\"\nThen I was all like \"..................oh................\"\n\n(If you didn't see my last video or have no idea whom I is and happen to just be visiting my channel-eth, basically I just decided to try to upload something every 10th, 20th, and 30th of every month to get into a better habit of making videos)\n\nANYWHO!!! In order to keep up with my new schedule, I dug up 3 old videos that I never ended up finishing and....well I finished them, haha. \n\nThey were previously deemed unworthy of uploading by my perfectionistic brain, but apparently in order to overcome perfectionism, one must actually try to not be perfectionistic....that sounds stupid though, I don't buy it. \n\nBUT yeah, the other two deleted videos will be up tomorrow!! (Unless you're watching this in the future, then they're already up, unless I tragically died editing them on my laptop from an explosion caused by my proneness to accidently spilling drinks on technology)\n\nAND the impression video will either be the video on the 30th, OR it will be like a bonus in between the 20th and 30th video, aside from the other video containing the other two deleted videos tomorrow or in the past depending on the time you are reading this....this is getting confusing now, so OK BYE\n\nP.S. In case you couldn't tell, I'm a total Kidult  ^_____^\n\nP.S.S. Also I'm now just realizing with autocorrect that I totally spelt kidult wrong in the video and title haha\n\nP.S.S.S. Seriously though, like 92% of peoples over 18 seem to totally hate snow. \n\nP.S.S.S.S. Me and my sister saw like...2 kids in our neighborhood outside playing in the snow\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S. AND, we totally outlasted them too, like by 7 hours\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S. There was this one dude though that beat us\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. He was like taking a nap all day long face down in a pile of red snow right next to where the coyotes in our neighborhood live\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. My future wife must like snow\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Be an Anna\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Not an Elsa\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. I mean, because of the do you want to build a snowman song...\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Elsa's still cool\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. And technically she literally can MAKE snow so....hmm...\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. ALL, I'm asking is for my future wife to have the kiddultness of Anna as well as the slightly freakish mutant-like super powers of being able to summon snow from her fingers\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK???!?\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Did you know that snow is actually 96% organic and almost 61% gluten free???\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. If you're still reading this, randomly type \"Plumpaplootikus,\" to confuse anyone else who hasn't read this far\n\nOK BYE!!\n\nMUSIC STUFFS:\nMistake the Getaway Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\n Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\n http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\nJaunty Gumption Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\n Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\n http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\nKillers Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\n Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\n http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/"

I'm still working on my perfectionisms...I'm not very good at working on my perfectionisms :)\n\nBUT, anywhooose I'm back again, sorry for continuously dying!!\n\nThiiiiiiiiis video was just a way of me getting back into the habit of making videos again, soooooo sorry to anyone who might have been expecting something a little more....original??\n\nIt's like if you're trying to get into the pool because it's cold but you don't want to jus jump in, so you have to stick your foot in first to slowly get used to it, which is a totally bad analogy, because I always do the exact opposite. Unless of course, we're talking Titanic level of coldness, in which case, I probably wouldn't just jump right into the water. Mostly because I'd already be in the water and not have a choice. But I'd help Rose get used the water by tipping over the door. Everyone knows you're colder when you get out of the water than when you're IN the water. Why do you think Rose was shaking so much while Jack was just peacefully sleeping?? \n\nSpeaking of sleeping, it's 7 AM right now....and I haven't slept in like 24 hours now :)\n\nSee, I have this teeeeeeny tiny problem of adding more and more to videos until videos that were supposed to only be like 4 minutes long end up being...well, like over 10 minutes long haha.\n\nI just don't understand how normal people make short videos. Not counting those vlogs where they are like 15-20 minutes long. You know, the ones where it says something on the video like \"BIGGEST SNOW FORT EVER!!!! ALMOST DIED!!! AVALANCHE!!! GALLONS OF BLOOD EVERYWHERE!!!! TOTAL CARNAGE!!!! SOME OLD LADY WAS CRUSHED BY THE AVALANCHE!!!\" and then like 16 minutes into the 20 minute video you finally see the snow fort and it's like only 2 feet high and gets knocked over by a Chihuahua?? You know, those kind of videos. \n\nI'm talking about the non-vloggy videos that other people make and somehow keep under my average of like 6 hours. ARE THEY LIKE FREAKING WARLOCKS OR WIZARDS OR SOMETHING!?!!??!??!??!??!?!??! I don't get it\n\nSpeaking of Wizards, guess whose going to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter this week??!?!?!?!?! :D\n\nLots of people probably\n\nI'm not though. But I AM going to that other place that's right next to it....I forget what it's called. You know the one with the giant rat whose friends with the talking dog and goose?? \n\nBut if you're reading this and you're going to be there, come say hello. I'll be somewhere within the 40 square miles of Disney World for like a week. I'll be the guy with the clothes on\n\nP.S. Or not\n\nP.S.S. Florida gets really hot, you know??\n\nP.S.S.S. I've got to stay cool somehow\n\nP.S.S.S.S. Donald Duck is like half naked all the time, so I honestly don't see the big deal.\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S. And Pluto is like...always naked\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S. I know, you're thinking, \"Well duh, he's a dog,\" but you're forgetting that Goofy is also a dog. He's just like some kind of advanced species of dog that can talk and walk.....but then again, Mickey and Donald and literally every other character in their world is a walking talking animal...so doesn't that mean that Pluto is the weird one????\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S BUT then again, I've seen OTHER character who had pet dogs.....Also, where are all the humans???? Was there like, some kind of war between animals and humans when they became advanced enough and then wiped out all of us??\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S OH MY GOD!!! THAT'S IT!!!!! THINK ABOUT IT!!!! WHAT ANIMAL IS MOST LOYAL TO HUMANS???? Dogs. The Dogs clearly fought along side us humans and when we were eliminated, the animals took the dogs as pets and eventually some of their breeds learned how to walk and talk while others...didn't\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.

                "description": "Don't Hug Me I'm Scared Parody \"You'll Be Extinct\" (DHMIS Inspired)\n\nOKIE DOKIE, sooooooooo I wasn't able to finish the YouTuber impression video by today, like I had hoped I would be able to, sooooooooo I decided to upload one of the random parodies from the video that was already finished to have at least something up, since I kind of sort of did say that I would have the YouTuber impression video finished by today....SORRY!!! \n\nBUTT, the impression video is more than half way finished. I'm like 98.2% sure that I can finish it before November, so it should be up next week.\n\nTHIS video is a parody, type, thing of the Don't Hug Me I'm Scared videos...but not really a parody because those are already parodies...if you've seen my other impression videos, I probably don't need to explain how my mind just wanders off and makes a random skit related to the impressions that I'm doing...but if you don't normally watch my impression videos, this is basically like an original song that was inspired by the DHMIS videos. Like a fan-film, but with a much lower budget and not quite as nice puppets!! \n\nBut, yeah, I actually made this song all by myself. Well, my sister helped in some parts. I'll give her 2% credit (Even though she keeps refusing any credit at all. STOP BEING SO STUBBORN BRANDI!!!!!!)\n\nShe also convinced me to put this song on iTunes, sooooooo it should be up there pretty soon too. I think it takes them like a week to approve it or something before it's actually up. \n\nI'm basically one of those YouTubers who just wake up one day and are all randomly like, \"...I feel like being a singer now,\" and then they randomly  make a song.\n\nBut I made TWO songs, so I'm basically a pro already. (The other one is also from the impression video...it's a rap...in battle form...that is epic....hint, hint at one of the other impressions).\n\nP.S. The Don't Hug Me I'm Scared songs are usually suuuuuper deep with their meanings, buuuuuuut I wrote and made this in like 1 day, so please forgive me for my lack of super deepness and meaningfulness\n\nP.S.S. Although, extinction is a pretty deepful and meaningful topic\n\nP.S.S.S. Except when talking about humans, because you know, they're my least favorite animal. \n\nP.S.S.S.S. (No offense if you're human)\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S. I'll be totally honest, when the monkeys or robots or aliens take over, I'm probably switching sides. Sorry\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S. Oh, but if dogs try to take over, I will DEFINITELY switch sides...not sure about cats...I mean, I like them more than dogs...but I feel like there is a chance they might use me as bait or something...eh, I'll still join them\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.

                    "description": "Don't Hug Me I'm Scared Parody \"You'll Be Extinct\" (DHMIS Inspired)\n\nOKIE DOKIE, sooooooooo I wasn't able to finish the YouTuber impression video by today, like I had hoped I would be able to, sooooooooo I decided to upload one of the random parodies from the video that was already finished to have at least something up, since I kind of sort of did say that I would have the YouTuber impression video finished by today....SORRY!!! \n\nBUTT, the impression video is more than half way finished. I'm like 98.2% sure that I can finish it before November, so it should be up next week.\n\nTHIS video is a parody, type, thing of the Don't Hug Me I'm Scared videos...but not really a parody because those are already parodies...if you've seen my other impression videos, I probably don't need to explain how my mind just wanders off and makes a random skit related to the impressions that I'm doing...but if you don't normally watch my impression videos, this is basically like an original song that was inspired by the DHMIS videos. Like a fan-film, but with a much lower budget and not quite as nice puppets!! \n\nBut, yeah, I actually made this song all by myself. Well, my sister helped in some parts. I'll give her 2% credit (Even though she keeps refusing any credit at all. STOP BEING SO STUBBORN BRANDI!!!!!!)\n\nShe also convinced me to put this song on iTunes, sooooooo it should be up there pretty soon too. I think it takes them like a week to approve it or something before it's actually up. \n\nI'm basically one of those YouTubers who just wake up one day and are all randomly like, \"...I feel like being a singer now,\" and then they randomly  make a song.\n\nBut I made TWO songs, so I'm basically a pro already. (The other one is also from the impression video...it's a rap...in battle form...that is epic....hint, hint at one of the other impressions).\n\nP.S. The Don't Hug Me I'm Scared songs are usually suuuuuper deep with their meanings, buuuuuuut I wrote and made this in like 1 day, so please forgive me for my lack of super deepness and meaningfulness\n\nP.S.S. Although, extinction is a pretty deepful and meaningful topic\n\nP.S.S.S. Except when talking about humans, because you know, they're my least favorite animal. \n\nP.S.S.S.S. (No offense if you're human)\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S. I'll be totally honest, when the monkeys or robots or aliens take over, I'm probably switching sides. Sorry\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S. Oh, but if dogs try to take over, I will DEFINITELY switch sides...not sure about cats...I mean, I like them more than dogs...but I feel like there is a chance they might use me as bait or something...eh, I'll still join them\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.

I know what you're thinking, \"The ghost is just you in a sheet with a poorly drawn face on it,\" but you're wrong. That face is not poorly drawn. Because it is not drawn at all. Because it is a REAL GHOST FACE!!!!!!!\n\nI've never been properly trained in ghost detectiving, but after this experience, I think I might quit my job and just investimigate ghost full time, kind of like Scooby Doo, which kind of works out because I've been told I look like Shaggy. Some of my friends throughout my life have even called me Shaggy, like a nickname you know?\n\nAlso because they couldn't remember my name. Also most of them weren't actually friends with me. Just like classmates or co-workers who just happened to forget my name a lot. \n\nBUT I'LL SHOW THEM!!! After I release this ghost footage and it goes viral and has finished spreading around the world, proving ghosts to be real, skeptics will be all \"ERMAGHERD!!! GHOSTS ARE REAAAALLL!!! WE WERE SO TOTALLY WRONG!!!\" \nAnd then all the scientist people will give me a million dollars because I made an important scientific discovery. Kind of like that guy who got the footage of Bigfoot. \nYou know why you never have heard from that guy again?? BECAAAAAUSE he's like a gazillionaire now!!!  He will go down in history as one of the most important scientifical people of all time, just like I will now also go down as one of the most scientifical peoples. \n\nNext up, I shall find real footage of mermaids...and if the girl mermaids are hot, I shall also marry one and call her Ariel and then we can live happily ever after with our cute little mutant 1/3rd fish babies. \nAnd Flouder and Sebastian will be my best friends and sing songs with me and watch the kids when me and the wife don't feel like watching them. Not because we don't like them, it's just that we haven't had much time alone as a couple since the kids were born, you know? It's super stressful being the parents of 1/3rd mutant fish babies!! \n\nThat reminds me, before I set off on my quest to find my fish wife, I need to get a talking dog. OOH!! If I get one within the next day, I can totally go as Shaggy and Scooby for Halloween!!! Is anyone reading this a professional dog speaking coach?? Because if you are, I will totally pay you....hold on let me check my pocket.....FOURTEEN DOLLARS and SIXTEEN CENTS to train my Scooby Doo lookalike to talk. \n\nP.S. Speaking of Scooby Doo, those guys are pretty lucky that they've never ran into a bad guy who...you know, had like an actual weapon...I feel like the episodes might have ended a lot faster then\n\nP.S.S. Is that an actual job?? Like solving mysteries?? Not like normal mysteries, but like mysteries where something in haunted and then someone hires you to come solve the mystery and then pull the mask off some old guy who was trying to scare everyone\n\nP.S.S.S. If it's not, I'm totally up for starting a real life one right now. For reals. I call dibs on Shaggy, mostly just because I won't have to put any effort into changing my look whatsoever...and also because I get to hang out with a talking dog the whole time...and also the food\n\nP.S.S.S.S. If you want to be part of my real life Scooby Doo gang, just say which character you want to be in the comments!! It's ok if there are more than one of each character. We can then have understudies that can take our place in the even that the original is not able to fulfill their mystery solving responsibilities. Or maybe we can just start a business and then have like 50 different groups all over the world solving mysteries and stuff. \n\nP.S.S.S.S.S. If you have read this far into the video description thingy and have ever experienced a supernaturalish thingy before, you know, one as supernaturalish or even MORE supernaturalish as the supernaturalishness that occurred in this supernatural video, share your supernaturalish story in the comments!!...you know, if you feel like it. I'm basically an expert at this point in all supernaturalish things, so I can probably tell you if your supernaturalishness is legit or not. But it probably is. Except for the evil scary possessionishy ones. Because if I say those ones aren't real, I will probably get possessed and that would really complicate my life, you know??\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.

If you'd like to see more of my amazing, life-altering Tutorials, feel free to like Misses Mufflebuns video to let me know you'd like to see more. Hmmhmmhm. Ta ta for now! And be sure to have fun at your local Happy Halloween gatherings this year. \n \n- Sincerely, Misses Mufflebuns \n\n\n\nOKIE DOKIE!!! Soooooooo this video was a little different from my usual impression videos I make, but I wanted to try to start making other types of random parody/skit videos like this one, so hopefully you like it! But if you're someone who prefers the impression videos, I have a new one coming in November!! (YouTuber impressions)\n\nAlso, if you saw the update video I made a few days ago, I was talking about how I wanted to plan on making 6 Halloween videos this year, but wasn't sure if it would be 6 because I'm really bad at estimicating how long it will take to film and edit videos, aaaaaaaaaaand yeah, this one took a little longer than I thought, haha. But I still think I can get another 2 -4 of them finished before Halloween. \n\nP.S. When we were filming the basketball scene, there were these construction guys that were doing work right outside the tennis court fence. One of them was either filming us or taking a picture, sooooo there might be a totally random picture or video of me dressed up as an old lady crossing over my sister online somewhere, haha\n\nP.S.S. Also, it is insanely hard to move in that night gown thingy. I have no idea how actual Grandmothers cross people over or dunk in those things. I had to lower the hoop down to 9 feet because my legs couldn't move around as much so I couldn't jump as high...9 FEET!!! That's so embarrassing\n\nP.S.S.S. Sorry if any parts of the video had really loud or quiet parts, me not so good with sound editing yet\n\nP.S.S.S.S. I think I look pretty hot as an old lady, don't you?? I mean, usually I prefer girls a little closer to my age, but personally, I think I pull of the Grandmother look pretty well\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S. No Pizza delivery people were actually harmed in the making of this video. \n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S. I had to say Pizza delivery PEOPLE because it would be offensive to say Pizza men since women can be Pizza delivery people too\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Pizza delivery people are true heroes. Just like Firefighters, they save lives. By making people not have to move for food...well technically you have to still move to go get the pizza...but it's only like 10 feet, then you're set for the rest of the day...or week if you order like 20 of them...I really want some pizza now...but unfortunately I have to leave for my job, bleh....I wonder if I can have pizza delivered there??...\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. If you read this far, what's your favorite kind of pizza?? Mine is pineapple...yes I'm one of those people. WHAT?? A guy can't enjoy two things he enjoys together??? I like Pineapples AND I like Pizza, SOOOOO naturally, I like both together, what's wrong with that??\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.

                    "description": "Hello Dearies, Misses Mufflebuns here. I do hope you enjoyed my Ghost Costume tutorial. If you'd like to see more of my amazing, life-altering Tutorials, feel free to like Misses Mufflebuns video to let me know you'd like to see more. Hmmhmmhm. Ta ta for now! And be sure to have fun at your local Happy Halloween gatherings this year. \n \n- Sincerely, Misses Mufflebuns \n\n\n\nOKIE DOKIE!!! Soooooooo this video was a little different from my usual impression videos I make, but I wanted to try to start making other types of random parody/skit videos like this one, so hopefully you like it! But if you're someone who prefers the impression videos, I have a new one coming in November!! (YouTuber impressions)\n\nAlso, if you saw the update video I made a few days ago, I was talking about how I wanted to plan on making 6 Halloween videos this year, but wasn't sure if it would be 6 because I'm really bad at estimicating how long it will take to film and edit videos, aaaaaaaaaaand yeah, this one took a little longer than I thought, haha. But I still think I can get another 2 -4 of them finished before Halloween. \n\nP.S. When we were filming the basketball scene, there were these construction guys that were doing work right outside the tennis court fence. One of them was either filming us or taking a picture, sooooo there might be a totally random picture or video of me dressed up as an old lady crossing over my sister online somewhere, haha\n\nP.S.S. Also, it is insanely hard to move in that night gown thingy. I have no idea how actual Grandmothers cross people over or dunk in those things. I had to lower the hoop down to 9 feet because my legs couldn't move around as much so I couldn't jump as high...9 FEET!!! That's so embarrassing\n\nP.S.S.S. Sorry if any parts of the video had really loud or quiet parts, me not so good with sound editing yet\n\nP.S.S.S.S. I think I look pretty hot as an old lady, don't you?? I mean, usually I prefer girls a little closer to my age, but personally, I think I pull of the Grandmother look pretty well\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S. No Pizza delivery people were actually harmed in the making of this video. \n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S. I had to say Pizza delivery PEOPLE because it would be offensive to say Pizza men since women can be Pizza delivery people too\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Pizza delivery people are true heroes. Just like Firefighters, they save lives. By making people not have to move for food...well technically you have to still move to go get the pizza...but it's only like 10 feet, then you're set for the rest of the day...or week if you order like 20 of them...I really want some pizza now...but unfortunately I have to leave for my job, bleh....I wonder if I can have pizza delivered there??...\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. If you read this far, what's your favorite kind of pizza?? Mine is pineapple...yes I'm one of those people. WHAT?? A guy can't enjoy two things he enjoys together??? I like Pineapples AND I like Pizza, SOOOOO naturally, I like both together, what's wrong with that??\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. With cheese only\n\nOKBYE!!!!\n\n\nHeartwarming Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\nTeddy Bear Waltz Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/"

I don't usually make parodies like this, and by \"Don't usually,\" I mean never, well at least not by themselves like this one, though technically these ones were supposed to be part of my Beauty and the Beast impressions video, but I didn't use them because then the impression video would have been super long, so maybe these don't really count as solo parodies?? \n\nBUTT anywho, if you enjoyed this video, feel free to share it or like the video and then maybe I'll make more!! And by maybe, I mean I will make more parodies. I was using the maybe to get free likes and shares. \nBecause I'm a YouTuber and that's like the YouTuber law or something. You know, the whole \"Don't forget to like and share...and...comment...and...subscribe...and follow me on my 347 other social media accounts!!! Please!!! I...I don't know why...I...I just need the love, I need to be loved!! I NEED TO BE LOVED!!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nThere was one other Beauty and the Beast parody clip I didn't use, but that one was like 3-4 minutes long...probably, I haven't finished editing it yet...I'll get around to it...by next year...\n\nOH, but I'm thinking I might start putting together unused or deleted videos like that one into some new kind of video on my channel, one filled with unused or deleted videos that I didn't use or deleted, which I shall call...Unused/Deleted Videos!! (Creative title, right??)\n\nHave you ever thought about how weird it would be if one of the employees in the Beasts' castle were actually turned into toilets? Or even how awkward that would be?? \n\nI mean, would the Beast just decide to take his business outside or something?? And what about all the other employees?? Do they ever have to use the toilet anymore?? Or are they like unable to now?? Does Lumiere drop little wax deuces?? (These are the, crucially important, unanswered questions I think Disney needs to answer...)\n\nIf you're a normal watcher of my awkwardness, new impression stuffs coming soon to a YouTube's near you!!!\n\nYou know what I was randomly thinking about yesterday?? How we sleep for 1/3rd of our lives and spend another 1/3rd of our lives in school/working...that's pretty deep and kind of dark, isn't it?? WELL, anyways, after much thinkings with my brain, I have decided to spend the rest of my life as an immortal Vampire. THEN, I won't have to sleep as much and won't ever die!!...well unless someone puts a piece of wood in my heart of course...or if I stay out in the sun too long...and then there's the whole having to drink blood thing too, which I mean, isn't a bad thing, you know, if you're a vampire, I don't mean to offend your peoples, but drinking blood just isn't my thing, I'm just into food, you know??  \n\n P.S. If you would like to see me and my sister try to make more parodies, leave a comment below if you maybe have a request!!! X)\n\nP.S.S. YES, that was real CGI animation that I used for the Mrs. Potts and Chip scene. That's why it looked so realistic. \n\nP.S.S.S. NO, those weren't actual strings tied around Mrs. Potts and Chip that I used to drag their bodies across the table, those were also CGI. They were CGI strings.\n\nP.S.S.S.S. Chip was almost hurt in the making of this video\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S. Seriously, he fell onto the ground multiple times and somehow didn't break\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S. If he had broken, I'm sure it would have emotionally scarred me for life\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. You know, because Beauty and the Beast and Toy Story and Pixar make all of us psychologically believe literally everything in the world is alive and has feelings.\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.....Oh yeah, and Feelings also have feelings too....(Inside Out)\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. I wonder if the other inanimate objects that are alive have the feelings from Inside out inside of them...Or if the actual feelings, like Joy and Sadness have feelings...is there like a never ending group of feelings inside every feeling??

I don't usually make parodies like this, and by \"Don't usually,\" I mean never, well at least not by themselves like this one, though technically these ones were supposed to be part of my Beauty and the Beast impressions video, but I didn't use them because then the impression video would have been super long, so maybe these don't really count as solo parodies?? \n\nBUTT anywho, if you enjoyed this video, feel free to share it or like the video and then maybe I'll make more!! And by maybe, I mean I will make more parodies. I was using the maybe to get free likes and shares. \nBecause I'm a YouTuber and that's like the YouTuber law or something. You know, the whole \"Don't forget to like and share...and...comment...and...subscribe...and follow me on my 347 other social media accounts!!! Please!!! I...I don't know why...I...I just need the love, I need to be loved!! I NEED TO BE LOVED!!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nThere was one other Beauty and the Beast parody clip I didn't use, but that one was like 3-4 minutes long...probably, I haven't finished editing it yet...I'll get around to it...by next year...\n\nOH, but I'm thinking I might start putting together unused or deleted videos like that one into some new kind of video on my channel, one filled with unused or deleted videos that I didn't use or deleted, which I shall call...Unused/Deleted Videos!! (Creative title, right??)\n\nHave you ever thought about how weird it would be if one of the employees in the Beasts' castle were actually turned into toilets? Or even how awkward that would be?? \n\nI mean, would the Beast just decide to take his business outside or something?? And what about all the other employees?? Do they ever have to use the toilet anymore?? Or are they like unable to now?? Does Lumiere drop little wax deuces?? (These are the, crucially important, unanswered questions I think Disney needs to answer...)\n\nIf you're a normal watcher of my awkwardness, new impression stuffs coming soon to a YouTube's near you!!!\n\nYou know what I was randomly thinking about yesterday?? How we sleep for 1/3rd of our lives and spend another 1/3rd of our lives in school/working...that's pretty deep and kind of dark, isn't it?? WELL, anyways, after much thinkings with my brain, I have decided to spend the rest of my life as an immortal Vampire. THEN, I won't have to sleep as much and won't ever die!!...well unless someone puts a piece of wood in my heart of course...or if I stay out in the sun too long...and then there's the whole having to drink blood thing too, which I mean, isn't a bad thing, you know, if you're a vampire, I don't mean to offend your peoples, but drinking blood just isn't my thing, I'm just into food, you know??  \n\n P.S. If you would like to see me and my sister try to make more parodies, leave a comment below if you maybe have a request!!! X)\n\nP.S.S. YES, that was real CGI animation that I used for the Mrs. Potts and Chip scene. That's why it looked so realistic. \n\nP.S.S.S. NO, those weren't actual strings tied around Mrs. Potts and Chip that I used to drag their bodies across the table, those were also CGI. They were CGI strings.\n\nP.S.S.S.S. Chip was almost hurt in the making of this video\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S. Seriously, he fell onto the ground multiple times and somehow didn't break\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S. If he had broken, I'm sure it would have emotionally scarred me for life\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. You know, because Beauty and the Beast and Toy Story and Pixar make all of us psychologically believe literally everything in the world is alive and has feelings.\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.....Oh yeah, and Feelings also have feelings too....(Inside Out)\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. I wonder if the other inanimate objects that are alive have the feelings from Inside out inside of them...Or if the actual feelings, like Joy and Sadness have feelings...is there like a never ending group of feelings inside every feeling?? MORE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS DISNEY!!!!"

                "description": "Hi there!!! Welcome to the video description thingy!! \nThis video was SUPPOSED to be up the week before the new Beauty and the Beast came out...also, there's like 15 minutes of Beauty and the Beast parodies that I couldn't use because the video would have been about 20 minutes long then, which I thought is probably a Liiiiiiiiitle too long for an impression video...somehow in my head when I estimated how long the whole video would be, I predicted 6 minutes...yeah, I'm really bad at estimicating stuff...haha...SORRY!!!\n\nBUT anywho, if you do watch my videos, I'll be uploading one or two Beauty and the Beast parody videos sometime this week!!...ONLY about  a month after the movie came out!!! CLUTCH!!\nOh and also, sorry about the inconsistent lighting, I just bought one of those softboxes and ring lights and I'm still trying to figure out the best place to put them. Maybe I should just film in total darkness, that would cut back on the whole filming and setup part by a lot. Plus, then when I was editing, I wouldn't have to stare at my face for hours and hours and keep noticing how the lighting keeps changing. OR I could even just hire the actual actors to come do the voices and no one would even know, MUWAHAHAHAHAHAAAA!!! I will hire Emma Watson first...then I'll keep hiring her to keep doing more impressions of herself, just so that we can hang out, because she's awesome, because she's Emma Watson.\n\nDo you think Beast ever gets paranoid that he's constantly being watched? That's probably why he stopped going out in public. Every time he went on a date, he would start talking to his spoon and his date would think he's crazy...I guess it could also have to do with the fact that he's basically a giant werewolf looking thing...but there's an easy solution for that, just say he's a cosplayer or only go out on Halloween and win a bunch of costume contests. \nThen again, Halloween wasn't around back then...and people in the olden days weren't exactly...smart...\nFirst Guy \"That girl was reading! She must be a witch!\"\nSecond Guy \"Well, there's only one way to be sure. Let's tie a rock to her feet and throw her in the water.\"\nFirst Guy \"What will that do?\"\nSecond Guy \"Well, you see, witches float, because the water rejects their unnatural bodies, so if she sinks, then we know she's NOT a witch.\"\nFirst Guy \"What a completely logical and unflawed plan!! Genius!!\"\n\nYEP, that actually happened...dumb, right?? I mean, why would someone think water reject witches bodies?? That's so stupid, witches are just humans that happen to have magical powers and/or go to Hogwarts. And also, most witches are good, I mean, sure, some practice dark magic like he who shall not be named, but that kid with the lightning bolt and his friends, Ed Sheeran and Belle took care of him. \nP.S. Did you like my amazing Beast cosplay?? I made it all by myself...well technically I bought everything, so technically I didn't make a single thing...BUT, I put it all together like a pro costume designer person. They could have probably just used my Beast costume for the new movie\nP.S.S. Speaking of the new movie, I was kind of surprised they didn't have Josh Gad do some kind of Olaf reference/Easter Egg thing, mostly just because, well he's Olaf, but also because in the original movie Lefou hid inside a snowman while hiding outside Belle's home. Man, Disney just can't get anything right, can they??\nP.S.S.S. That was sarcasm...I'm totally obsessed with all things Disney, like on an unhealthy level. Me and my future wife will spontaneously break out into random Disney songs all day long and then someday when we have kids, they will only know how to communicate though spontaneously choreographed musical numbers. \nP.S.S.S.S. Thanks to my sister, Brandi for being in this video. You can check out her channel if you'd like. She's an insanely good singer who likes to sing songs on her song covering channel of songs. (BrandiAlden1)\nP.S.S.S.S.S Those Beauty and the Beast parodies I was talking about will be up sometime this week\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S. I feel like I already wrote that...\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Oh well, too late to go back and double check. You know what they say! Why double check your work when you don't want to!!\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S Seriously though, what's up with Mrs. Potts other 28 children?? I mean, you don't even see them at the end of the movie when everyone is human. CLEARLY, someone has a favorite child",

                    "title": "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST IMPRESSIONS!!!",
                    "description": "Hi there!!! Welcome to the video description thingy!! \nThis video was SUPPOSED to be up the week before the new Beauty and the Beast came out...also, there's like 15 minutes of Beauty and the Beast parodies that I couldn't use because the video would have been about 20 minutes long then, which I thought is probably a Liiiiiiiiitle too long for an impression video...somehow in my head when I estimated how long the whole video would be, I predicted 6 minutes...yeah, I'm really bad at estimicating stuff...haha...SORRY!!!\n\nBUT anywho, if you do watch my videos, I'll be uploading one or two Beauty and the Beast parody videos sometime this week!!...ONLY about  a month after the movie came out!!! CLUTCH!!\nOh and also, sorry about the inconsistent lighting, I just bought one of those softboxes and ring lights and I'm still trying to figure out the best place to put them. Maybe I should just film in total darkness, that would cut back on the whole filming and setup part by a lot. Plus, then when I was editing, I wouldn't have to stare at my face for hours and hours and keep noticing how the lighting keeps changing. OR I could even just hire the actual actors to come do the voices and no one would even know, MUWAHAHAHAHAHAAAA!!! I will hire Emma Watson first...then I'll keep hiring her to keep doing more impressions of herself, just so that we can hang out, because she's awesome, because she's Emma Watson.\n\nDo you think Beast ever gets paranoid that he's constantly being watched? That's probably why he stopped going out in public. Every time he went on a date, he would start talking to his spoon and his date would think he's crazy...I guess it could also have to do with the fact that he's basically a giant werewolf looking thing...but there's an easy solution for that, just say he's a cosplayer or only go out on Halloween and win a bunch of costume contests. \nThen again, Halloween wasn't around back then...and people in the olden days weren't exactly...smart...\nFirst Guy \"That girl was reading! She must be a witch!\"\nSecond Guy \"Well, there's only one way to be sure. Let's tie a rock to her feet and throw her in the water.\"\nFirst Guy \"What will that do?\"\nSecond Guy \"Well, you see, witches float, because the water rejects their unnatural bodies, so if she sinks, then we know she's NOT a witch.\"\nFirst Guy \"What a completely logical and unflawed plan!! Genius!!\"\n\nYEP, that actually happened...dumb, right?? I mean, why would someone think water reject witches bodies?? That's so stupid, witches are just humans that happen to have magical powers and/or go to Hogwarts. And also, most witches are good, I mean, sure, some practice dark magic like he who shall not be named, but that kid with the lightning bolt and his friends, Ed Sheeran and Belle took care of him. \nP.S. Did you like my amazing Beast cosplay?? I made it all by myself...well technically I bought everything, so technically I didn't make a single thing...BUT, I put it all together like a pro costume designer person. They could have probably just used my Beast costume for the new movie\nP.S.S. Speaking of the new movie, I was kind of surprised they didn't have Josh Gad do some kind of Olaf reference/Easter Egg thing, mostly just because, well he's Olaf, but also because in the original movie Lefou hid inside a snowman while hiding outside Belle's home. Man, Disney just can't get anything right, can they??\nP.S.S.S. That was sarcasm...I'm totally obsessed with all things Disney, like on an unhealthy level. Me and my future wife will spontaneously break out into random Disney songs all day long and then someday when we have kids, they will only know how to communicate though spontaneously choreographed musical numbers. \nP.S.S.S.S. Thanks to my sister, Brandi for being in this video. You can check out her channel if you'd like. She's an insanely good singer who likes to sing songs on her song covering channel of songs. (BrandiAlden1)\nP.S.S.S.S.S Those Beauty and the Beast parodies I was talking about will be up sometime this week\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S. I feel like I already wrote that...\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Oh well, too late to go back and double check. You know what they say! Why double check your work when you don't want to!!\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S Seriously though, what's up with Mrs. Potts other 28 children?? I mean, you don't even see them at the end of the movie when everyone is human. CLEARLY, someone has a favorite child"

BUTT, I'm going to try REAAAAAALLLYY hard to make stuff more often now. I work in retail, which has insanely random hours, which doesn't mix well when you have ADHD, which luckily I do, because it makes planning stuff and having a consistent schedule really difficult, and I mean, who DOESN'T want that, right?? Weirdos probably. Hah....\n\nActually, to be totally honest, I'm not really a planning type of person, I'm more of a do whatever my brain wants to do type of person, BUTT, I always want to make videos, BUTT my inconsistent job schedule messes with my brain, AND I need that to make videos because without it, most medical experts believe you'd have many difficulties in life. \n\nWhich reminds me, my birthday was on March 10th!! Yay for me!!! I had another short scene I cut from this video because it involved it being my birthday, but another lovely thing that ADHD kindly does for you is making you REAAAAAALLLY bad at estimicating how long it will take to do things (Or in my case edit things). So looking back now, I realize that it probably wasn't the smartest idea to film everything one day before I wanted to upload it (Which was on my birthday)\n\nI made a video year to say thanks for 200,000 subscribers where I was talking about how I would talk about why it takes me so long to upload videos, and this is kind of like that, BUTT, I thought of a cool idea for another video talking about ADHD, kind of like a parody type of thing. \n\nOOH, did you see some of my new decoration stuffs??? I'm trying to make the background look....less empty, ha. Also, I got some new lighting stuff too. I'm still experimenting with setup, but I feel like it's already a little better looking than before. (Well I mean, aside from my face, I can't really do anything about that, you know?? Unless you go the route of plastic surgery of course. But I feel like filling your face with plastic would be not good for your skin, right?? Then again, Barbie's face is 100% plastic and she doesn't look a day older than she did back in 1959. Ah, yes, the good old 50's. I remember it like it was around 30 years before I was born)\n\nSpeaking of the 50's, that's when Peter Pan came out...I mean in theatres...I'm pretty sure Peter is into Wendy...Then again, he's probably pretty lonely on that island...you know, I used to think, \"Hey, it would be cool to live in Neverland and never grow up, but now that I think of it, there were like only 6 girls on that island and most of them were mermaids...wait, actually, mermaids are hot, so yeah, I'll live there. Unless they're the kind from this one movie I saw about killer mermaids, I probably wouldn't want to date one of them...\" Oh yeah, there's also Tinkerbell and the fairies too. I ship Peter and Tinkerbell more than Wendy. \n\nThat reminds me!!! I also almost forgot!!!! Warning: Do NOT consume large amounts of Fairy Dust. Fairy dust is intended to be absorbed through the skin only. Consuming large amounts of fairy dust can lead to severe hallucinating. Many who ingest Fairy Dust are under the belief that they can fly, when in fact, they CAN'T. Fairy Dust will ONLY work if it is placed upon your head and/or hair. \n\nP.S. Fairy Dust is illegal in 28 states\n\nP.S.S. I AM going to plan on filming/editing and HOPEFULLY uploading a new impression video this week....if possible by Friday, HINT HINT\n\nP.S.S.S. Also, the YouTuber I'mpressions video I talked about will be probably just 15-25 YouTuber impressions and I'll make it like a series, so that I can make them faster.\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S. BUTT also because I'm REAAAAAAAAAALLY bad at estimating how long videos will end up being (Thank you again, ADHD), which is why my videos are usually like 20 minutes long, ha. SO if I do shorter impressions of YouTubers, then I can make the impressions a little longer each and not have the whole video be as long as a movie\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Speaking of movies, you know what movie I am totally excited to see and fan-man-ing over right now??? That new one with Emma Watson and the furry guy. HINT HINT. \nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Hermione is playing a live action version of one of my cartoon crushes in a Disney movie that also happens to be a musical....yep, I'll be at the midnight premiere....\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. \"I LIKE CHOCOLATE MIIIIILK!!!!!!!\" - If you know what cartoon I'm referencing, congratulations, you win a baby alpaca!!!!",

Or whatever holiday you might be celebrating around this time of year!!!! Or if you're not celebrating any holiday, then merry December!!! Unless December is against your religion, then merry...life...\n\nAnywho's, this video was originally supposed to be part of a \"12 days of Christmas,\" thingy that I was going to do, but I had to deal with a lot of stuff the past couple months (Some sad, some random, something there that wasn't there before) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAND medium story short, I ended up just being able to make this video...which I also had to put together pretty quickly, haha. \n\nOne of the good things that happened was my family going down to Orlando for Christmas vacation this year. We're visiting this one place that owned by this giant talking mouse, you may have heard of it before. I think it's pretty new. \n\nI was planning on doing something like I did for the Halloween impression video I made, with multiple parodies within the impression video, and I did film a couple others the night before we left (Me and my sister were up until 4 AM filming stuff, haha) buuuuuuut I didn't really like how one of them ended up. I still might post the other one though. \n\nBut I wanted to have at least something up, so like I was saying, I hope you enjoy. Please enjoy it. It will emotionally devastate me for years if you do not enjoy it. I will end up an old cat lady, but with guy parts instead of lady parts...or I guess an easier way of saying it would be a cat guy. Then again, I'm actually pretty allergic to cats, so I'd probably die of allergicness. \n\nSpeaking of allergicness, odds are that Santa's got to have some kind of food allergy, right? And odds are that someone, somewhere in the world used or accidently added whatever it is that he's allergic to (Let's just say sulfuric acid) to his cookie. Unless of course Santa is a wizard and can just tell what's in each cookie by looking at it. Kind of like the lego's in the lego movie, you know the one with the legos? \n\nP.S. What's your favorite Christmas or holiday movie to watch every year? (Even if it's not Christmas/December related) \n\nP.S.S. Mine is probably either the Grinch ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooor Christmas Vacation.\n\nP.S.S.S. OH!! Speaking of The Grinch, my youngest sister, the girl in this video, Brandi, is making a music video/cover of the song \"Where are you Christmas,\" FROM the movie, The Grinch, sooooooo if you want to check that out, you can just go check out her channel on Christmas day, which is when she's posting that one. (She's also posting Christmas songs every day all the way up to Christmas this month...well I guess she's BEEN doing that...she's almost done now, since it's almost Christmas) Her channel is called BrandiAlden1 if you want to check it out\n\nP.S.S.S.S. Is/did anyone else (Depending on when you're reading this) go/going to Disney World for Christmas this year??? \n\nP.S.S.S.S.S. I met THE Mickey Mouse. Like 20 times...in 20 totally different places...that guys fast. I'm thinking he's got to be on roids or something. I mean, how else does he get to place to place so quickly?...well, I mean, he does have that magic hat....WAIT!!! MAGIC HAT!!! I solved it!!! In the movie Santa Clause, when you knock Santa off the roof and put on his clothes (Which sounds really weird when you think about it) you BECOME Santa. SOOOOOO, that means his clothes keep him from going into anabalactic shock due to his allergicness to sulfuric acid!!! HA!!! BOO YAH!!!! I just solved the world's greatest mystery!!!  I'm chilling like a villain with coolness right now, except I'm not evil, so since I just solved a mystery, I guess I'm Groovy, like Scooby (Doo) HA!! get it?? Do you get it?? Because I honestly don't, it's 5 AM now and I only got like 2 hours of sleep yesterday...or was it today...does today count as yesterday since I haven't gone to sleep? Or does it still count as tomorrow??\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S. Always remember to drink your Ovaltine (Christmas movie reference, if you can guess what it's from, you win!!!",

Or whatever holiday you might be celebrating around this time of year!!!! Or if you're not celebrating any holiday, then merry December!!! Unless December is against your religion, then merry...life...\n\nAnywho's, this video was originally supposed to be part of a \"12 days of Christmas,\" thingy that I was going to do, but I had to deal with a lot of stuff the past couple months (Some sad, some random, something there that wasn't there before) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAND medium story short, I ended up just being able to make this video...which I also had to put together pretty quickly, haha. \n\nOne of the good things that happened was my family going down to Orlando for Christmas vacation this year. We're visiting this one place that owned by this giant talking mouse, you may have heard of it before. I think it's pretty new. \n\nI was planning on doing something like I did for the Halloween impression video I made, with multiple parodies within the impression video, and I did film a couple others the night before we left (Me and my sister were up until 4 AM filming stuff, haha) buuuuuuut I didn't really like how one of them ended up. I still might post the other one though. \n\nBut I wanted to have at least something up, so like I was saying, I hope you enjoy. Please enjoy it. It will emotionally devastate me for years if you do not enjoy it. I will end up an old cat lady, but with guy parts instead of lady parts...or I guess an easier way of saying it would be a cat guy. Then again, I'm actually pretty allergic to cats, so I'd probably die of allergicness. \n\nSpeaking of allergicness, odds are that Santa's got to have some kind of food allergy, right? And odds are that someone, somewhere in the world used or accidently added whatever it is that he's allergic to (Let's just say sulfuric acid) to his cookie. Unless of course Santa is a wizard and can just tell what's in each cookie by looking at it. Kind of like the lego's in the lego movie, you know the one with the legos? \n\nP.S. What's your favorite Christmas or holiday movie to watch every year? (Even if it's not Christmas/December related) \n\nP.S.S. Mine is probably either the Grinch ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooor Christmas Vacation.\n\nP.S.S.S. OH!! Speaking of The Grinch, my youngest sister, the girl in this video, Brandi, is making a music video/cover of the song \"Where are you Christmas,\" FROM the movie, The Grinch, sooooooo if you want to check that out, you can just go check out her channel on Christmas day, which is when she's posting that one. (She's also posting Christmas songs every day all the way up to Christmas this month...well I guess she's BEEN doing that...she's almost done now, since it's almost Christmas) Her channel is called BrandiAlden1 if you want to check it out\n\nP.S.S.S.S. Is/did anyone else (Depending on when you're reading this) go/going to Disney World for Christmas this year??? \n\nP.S.S.S.S.S. I met THE Mickey Mouse. Like 20 times...in 20 totally different places...that guys fast. I'm thinking he's got to be on roids or something. I mean, how else does he get to place to place so quickly?...well, I mean, he does have that magic hat....WAIT!!! MAGIC HAT!!! I solved it!!! In the movie Santa Clause, when you knock Santa off the roof and put on his clothes (Which sounds really weird when you think about it) you BECOME Santa. SOOOOOO, that means his clothes keep him from going into anabalactic shock due to his allergicness to sulfuric acid!!! HA!!! BOO YAH!!!! I just solved the world's greatest mystery!!!  I'm chilling like a villain with coolness right now, except I'm not evil, so since I just solved a mystery, I guess I'm Groovy, like Scooby (Doo) HA!! get it?? Do you get it?? Because I honestly don't, it's 5 AM now and I only got like 2 hours of sleep yesterday...or was it today...does today count as yesterday since I haven't gone to sleep? Or does it still count as tomorrow??\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S. Always remember to drink your Ovaltine (Christmas movie reference, if you can guess what it's from, you win!!!"

This took a LOOOONG time to make and I kind of had to rush it a little, but I hope those of you who watch my videos can still enjoy it :)\n\nHonestly, if I didn't stop myself from adding more and more, there would probably have been about another 5 or 6 cut scenes and the whole video would have been like 20 minutes long, XD.\n\nOH, also I had another 8 Halloween themed videos I wanted to make this month but couldn't because my job kept making me have to do my JOB!! Also every single one of those other videos would have taken less time than this one by a lot...I really need to do a better job of balancing video making, hahaha. \n\nMaybe I should just work on one big one (Like this one) and then do smaller non-impression videos on the side...or I can just lock my brother up in the basement and force him to edit all my videos for me. I know what you're thinking, no worries, I'll make sure to feed him AT LEAST twice a month...also I will probably have to built a basement because there isn't one. \n\nHEY!!! Since we're talking about basements, you know what basements are GREAT for storing?? I'll give you a clue, you usually force it into garbage bags and after a while it smells bad. Do you give up? The answer is easy!!! \n\nHUMAN garbage. You know, just regular garbage that humans throw away? If you keep it in the basement it won't smell so bad. It's also a good place to get attacked by evil girls with long black hair. \n\nSpeaking of the Ring, did you know they are making a new one? It's been like 58 years, hasn't it?? By now, the girl (Samara), probably just upgrade to YouTube. I mean, I don't have a SINGLE friend who still uses VHS tapes...because my friends don't exist...anymore..MUWAHAHAHAAHA!!!! Because they all moved away. Except for 2. But I haven't seen them since I was just a little whippersnapper, back in 1492.\n\nP.S. OOOH, if you're a fan of Hocus Pocus, check out my sisters channel!!! She will be uploading a cover music video thingy for the song \"Come Little Children!!!\"\n\nP.S.S. WHAT ARE YOU BEING FOR HALLOWEEN!?!??! (If you are being anything for Halloween) I'm going as Samara from the Ring. My costume will be amazing. I spent a lot of time on it. Probably about 12 minutes. When I bought it, that is. I bought a wig and then the clothes. I'm a very dedicated cosplayer.\n\nP.S.S.S. IT is 5:22 AM as I am typing this right now, and I...am...tired....right....now...\n\nP.S.S.S.S. OOH!!! Did you see my YouTube plaque thingy in the background?!?! It's the first one, the one you get for 100,000 subscribers!! I've had it for a while now, but I thought it would be cool to put in the background above my Snowboard...which I never get to use...BECAUSE IT NEVER SNOWS HERE!!!!\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S I want to build a snowman, HMU Anna...also, WE SHALL BE MARRIED in the morning!! (Haha, it's an enchanted reference, do you get it? They're making a second one of those too)\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S You know what movie needs a sequel? Twilight. There clearly weren't enough of them. There is just so much left to tell about Bella's story and far too many emotions that she can't contain and needs to let out. #WeWantMoreTwilightMovies\n\nLong note One Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\nHush Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\nFast Talkin Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\nFluffing a Duck Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\nPlucky Daisy Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",

Check out her tumblr at...bethaneybailey.tumblr.com.  ^_____^\n\nHELLOOOO\n\nSorry this video took like an extra week, but I seem to have a problem with not adding more and more stuff to videos as I'm editing it, haha. Anywhooo, this was supposed to be just Shrek impressions, then it was supposed to be 100 DreamWorks impressions, but then I realized that the video was over 10 minutes, so then I changed to 52 DreamWorks impressions...I think...I only counted once...and got distracted multiple times in the process...\n\nSPEAKING of distractions, I think my brain might be addicted to distractions. It's constantly looking for more and more. It won't stop using them. I'm concerned. I think I need to have one of those intervention things. My brain needs to admit it has a problem. That's the first step, brain. Admit that you have an addiction and stop getting so easily distra\n\n\nI thought I saw a Unicorn last week. I mean, obviously I didn't really see one, haha. It's Unicorn hibernation season. Speaking of hibernation, I have decided to officially start my own hibernation season. I have come to the conclusion that I...do not...like hot weather. Nope. I do not like it. If I'm President someday, I plan on making hot weather illegal.  Also, I will then make politics illegal, because they bore me and I don't like wearing suits. Plus, I'm not good at yelling and making fun of people, and I that seems like 99% of Politics. The other 1% is ignoring real issues in the world, like Unicorn endangerment. I remember, back when I was a kid in the 40's, I would go outside and see like 58 Unicorns rolling around, wrestling in the grass. That was a different Unicorn season though. \n\nSpeaking of back in the old days, remember back in the old days when you had to talk into your phone instead of just texting?? Apparently  our cell phones can too!!!! Crazy, right?!?!! \nMy phone starting making this weird noise last night, like a text alert, but longer, it was like a ringing. \nSo I picked it up and pushed a green button, then I heard a voice. At first I thought it was a paranormal activity, because I like to jump to super logical explanations right away, BUT then I tried talking back to the voice and realized it was my MOM!!! \nThen I jumped to the next most logical conclusion, that my Mom had angered one of our neighbors, who must have apparently been some kind of witch or warlock, who then used their powers to trap my Mom inside my phone until the dice read 5 or 8. \nBut then she explained to me how our phones can be used to actually talk to other people and how it's not only much quicker to talk than text, but also more personal and special than just taking turns texting. \nSo then I threw my phone out the window.

Check out her tumblr at...bethaneybailey.tumblr.com.  ^_____^\n\nHELLOOOO\n\nSorry this video took like an extra week, but I seem to have a problem with not adding more and more stuff to videos as I'm editing it, haha. Anywhooo, this was supposed to be just Shrek impressions, then it was supposed to be 100 DreamWorks impressions, but then I realized that the video was over 10 minutes, so then I changed to 52 DreamWorks impressions...I think...I only counted once...and got distracted multiple times in the process...\n\nSPEAKING of distractions, I think my brain might be addicted to distractions. It's constantly looking for more and more. It won't stop using them. I'm concerned. I think I need to have one of those intervention things. My brain needs to admit it has a problem. That's the first step, brain. Admit that you have an addiction and stop getting so easily distra\n\n\nI thought I saw a Unicorn last week. I mean, obviously I didn't really see one, haha. It's Unicorn hibernation season. Speaking of hibernation, I have decided to officially start my own hibernation season. I have come to the conclusion that I...do not...like hot weather. Nope. I do not like it. If I'm President someday, I plan on making hot weather illegal.  Also, I will then make politics illegal, because they bore me and I don't like wearing suits. Plus, I'm not good at yelling and making fun of people, and I that seems like 99% of Politics. The other 1% is ignoring real issues in the world, like Unicorn endangerment. I remember, back when I was a kid in the 40's, I would go outside and see like 58 Unicorns rolling around, wrestling in the grass. That was a different Unicorn season though. \n\nSpeaking of back in the old days, remember back in the old days when you had to talk into your phone instead of just texting?? Apparently  our cell phones can too!!!! Crazy, right?!?!! \nMy phone starting making this weird noise last night, like a text alert, but longer, it was like a ringing. \nSo I picked it up and pushed a green button, then I heard a voice. At first I thought it was a paranormal activity, because I like to jump to super logical explanations right away, BUT then I tried talking back to the voice and realized it was my MOM!!! \nThen I jumped to the next most logical conclusion, that my Mom had angered one of our neighbors, who must have apparently been some kind of witch or warlock, who then used their powers to trap my Mom inside my phone until the dice read 5 or 8. \nBut then she explained to me how our phones can be used to actually talk to other people and how it's not only much quicker to talk than text, but also more personal and special than just taking turns texting. \nSo then I threw my phone out the window.  It's in phone heaven now.\nR.I.P. Phoney 28 (That's was my phones name...He was named after my first 27 phones...my phones die a lot...)\n\nBUT anyways, like I was saying, I just ended up using like 50 something DreamWorks impressions since there are probably enough characters in some of the movies to make just impression videos of those movies, so if you like watching my impression videos and want to see me try a DreamWorks impression video about just one of their movies,  just say so in the comments!!\n \nP.S.

Yeah, my sister told me, supposedly, that if you keep the wigs folded nicely in plastic bags that they won't get all tangley  and frizzy and stuff.

THANK YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!\n\nI plan on filming some impression videos this next week too, soooooo hopefully I can have something uploaded by later next week or next weekend!!! \n\nSpeaking of weekend, I haven't had a weekend off from my job in over 7 months!! HAHAHAHA...oh golly gee willikers, I just LOVE my job sooooooooooo FREAKING much......I'm being sarcastic?? Pshh, what are you talking about!?!? I totally love my STUPID job, there isn't any FLIPPING sarcasm when I say that. Nonsense....\n\nDoes anyone else watch that show called Stranger Things??? Just because I heard it was good, but I haven't seen it. I can only focus on like 2 shows at the most at any time. \nRight now, Steven Universe is taking up one of those spots, so there is another empty one that I need to fill. Maybe I can just add it to my list of shows that I want to binge watch and catch up on. That list is only about 62 shows long, so I would probably see it before I die.\n \nSpeaking of death!! Did you notice my awesome animation in this video??!?!?! It looked so insanely profesh, right!??!!? (Profesh means professional, I just made that word up. It's okay, I'm allowed to, I'm a creative writing major, so I have like...authority...or....the street cred to do it) \n\nBut, yeah, those super lengthy Belluh animations were pretty much my first animations. I made it on this dandy new, state of the art animating software called \"Microsoft Paint.\" I don't know how many people know about this new way to animate stuff, but gosh, it only took me maybe 8 hours to do those short animations.

Why, I remember, we didn't even have color back then. Yep, every moving picture was in black and white...also everything else was in black and white.

                "description": "A long time ago...was the last time I uploaded a video...sorry!! (Those of you who watch my videos) This one took longer than expected...\n\nAnd for those of you who haven't seen one of my videos, \"Hey there, what's up? How's it going? Thanks for watching! Even if you only watched for a few seconds and then changed your mind. Or even if you watched the whole thing and want your potentially wasted time refunded. Hiiiiiii...also, due to overwhelming complaints, we are unable to refund lost time at the moment)\nBut anywho, being the Star Wars nerd that meesa be, I was unable to control my perfectionist-ism and wanted to try something a little different. \n\nI probably shouldn't do that for every impression video though, considering it took me about a month to work on this one...okeeday!! I gots an idea. I will keep making unnecessarily long and off topic impression videos like this, but I will also start trying to make shorter, but equally off topic impression videos too, so I can work on the big ones and keep uploading shorter impression and non-impression videos too.\n\nAlso, if you DO watch my videos, you might have noticed my new $1,000 camera. I got it off this drifter. He was dead, so I figured he wouldn't need it. Plus, he wasn't using it when I accidentally hit him with my car on purpose. \n\nKidding, kidding. hitting people with cars is bad. You should not do it. It's been illegal in most places I've moved from. I actually bought the camera fair and square from this nice guy who worked in a dark alley. He had lots of jewelry, plants, and some sugar he kept in bags too. Right after I left, a couple cops came by and escorted him away, so he must be an important person. \nSpeaking of the ridiculously hot weather, the weather here has been ridiculously hot...weather...it's about that time of year again that the Joshiiwuh's begin their summer migration, hiding away for a few months to protect their frail, easily-sun burnt, allergetic bodies from the blistering heat and allergens, only venturing out into the wilderness for occasional trips to swim in the local watering hole, where other, less allergy-prone and un-sun-burnable creatures spend all day on their backs, absorbing the suns healthy UV rays...\n\nP.S. Watering hole means swimming pool.\n\nP.S.S. Don't drink from your local watering holes\n\nP.S.S.S. Making this entire video in Roman Numerals was extremely difficult for someone who has trouble not messing up when using normal numbering\n\nP.S.S.S.S. I did it because Star Wars uses Roman Numerals...it...was...horrific...almost like I was back in high school having to...LEARN things!!!\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.  HEY, you know that company Ramen Noodles? They should make a Roman Numeral shaped meal thingy. They can call it Ramen Noodles' Roman Numerals...try saying that 5 times fast. \n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S. If you have any impression requests, leave them in the comments below, I'm already planning out a few of the more popularly requested ones like Gravity Falls, YouTubers, TMNT, MLP, Dreamworks, and a couple others, but I could always use more ideas\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. A lot of these impressions were just normal actor voices which I haven't really practiced...ever, haha, I usually just try cartoons, but real life peoples seems like it would be fun to try too, so I promise those will get better!!\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. Finding Dory comes out in less than a week!!!!!!!!!! RIGHTEOUS!!! RIGHTEOUS!!! RIGHTEOUS!!!

Over time, they will learn how to somehow travel across water and eventually take over the world and spend the rest of time shattering every single bottle in the universe. \n\nNo worries though, I will make sure to ask the next doctor/vet I see if I should have my pet penguin get a rabies shot or not. \n\nBecause now I understand that the fate of the world depends on it. \nZOMGUIN APOCALYPSE 2016!!!!!\n\nP.S.

                "description": "THE BACKGROUND MUSIC IN THIS VIDEO BELONGS TO DISNEY, I DO NOT OWN IT. \nIf you can't watch the video where you live, try going here: https://vimeo.com/152353627\n\nMy sister, Staci, grew up obsessed with Disney's movie, The Little Mermaid, so I wanted to try to help her live out one of her childhood dreams of being a Mermaid...but finding a real mermaid hasn't been crossed off my TO-DO-LIST yet....and none of the nearby grocery stores or fish markets sell severed mermaid tails, at least not that I know of....SO, I had to improvise. \n\n(On a side note, I still plan on finding a real mermaid someday and naming her Ariel, unless of course she already has a name, that's cool too.)\n\nEither way, I will probably ask her out...unless she's a reverse mermaid, you know head/top half of fish with human legs...I still have plenty of time to figure this out.)\n\nANYWAYS, back to the Christmas thingy. I came up with an idea I thought would be cool. \n\nI had my sister, Brandi, help set up a room with stuffed animals of underwater creatures, with fake treasure/jewels scattered around, seashells, a bubble machine, and a cool light projection thingy that made the ceiling look like we were underwater. \n\nTHEN, I bought some fleecy, blanket, material stuffs and had Brandi sew a mermaid tail blanket thing for my other sister, Staci. (The sister this present was for).\n\nAfter everything was set up, I played a video on the T.V. with me convincingly dressed up as Ursula...or some male-version of Ursula...who still had parts of the female Ursula's \"Figure...\" (Clearly I have a gift for cosplay though, right?)  \n\nThe video started out with me kind of re-enacting the scene from The Little Mermaid, where Ursula convinces Ariel to become a human, but with me convincing her of the opposite, to become a mermaid.\n\nI ended up asking Staci (The gift-receiving Sister), to unwrap a present underneath the couch she was sitting on. (Which was covered in a giant blue blanket to represent the underwater-ness of the setting).\n\nIn the present was the mermaid blanket tail that Brandi had made (The Gift-Assisting Sister). Staci put on the mermaid tail and sang the part where Ariel goes \"Ah, Ah, Ahh, Ah, Ahh, Ahhh...\" \n(You know, the part in this video where my other Sister, Brandi, sang. That wasn't originally there, just added it for this video for additional randomness, hehe)\n\nAlso, while she was singing and slipping the mermaid tail on, I stood in front of her and started violently shaking a blanket in front of her (To represent the mermaid transformation process, obviously).  \n\nThe last part of the video was me trying an impression of Tiny Tim (R.I.P.), whom I am convinced, serenades you upon death as you descend into the sky (Or wherever your respective beliefs and/or preferences takes or doesn't  you.)\n\nAnyways, it was really fun to set up and embarrass myself in front of my family, which honestly is something I'm really good at. My family thought that I should further embarrass myself by posting the video on YouTube, so I did!! \nWell not all of it...but the ending...the whole thing was like 13 minutes or something...you can see more of it on Brandi's channel if you want, there is a slightly longer version on that one that I put up so my mom could share it with our relatives and stuff.\n\nFor those of you who watch my video or are subscribed to my channel, HEY!!! WHAT'S UP?!?!?! HOW WAS YOUR CHRISTMAHANNAKWANZIKAS AND/OR OTHER HOLIDAYS???? HOW MANY NEW YEARS RESOLUTIONS HAVE YOU ALREADY LOST??? I'M AT 12 SO FAR!!!! \n\nP.S. No, I did not film this underwater with my new GoPro camera, believe it or not, it was actually a Green Screen!! Crazy, right?? You probably had no idea that I was actually using a Green Screen, did you?? \n\nP.S.S. No, that wasn't my actual hair, believe it or not, those were actually wigs!!! Insane, right?? You probably had NO idea that those perfect condition wigs, that I toss in a box, were actually fake, did you??\n\nP.S.S.S. Actually, Brandi did something referred to as \"Combing,\" to that one red one out before filming the new scenes with me...this \"Combing,\" apparently involves running these spiky needles on a stick through the hair repeatedly. TECHNOLOGY!!!! \n\nP.S.S.S.S. No, I did not undergo breast augmentation before filming this video, believe it or not, those were actually volleyballs under my shirt!!! Wicked camera trick, eh???\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S. Yes, that was me singing...except for when my sister was singing...that was her singing....but anywhoo, the usual apologies for any pitchy-ness or whatever I may have messed up on. 99.9% of the time when I sing, it's when I'm alone...in the shower...or my car...you know, the usual stuff, mostly Britney Spears stuff to build up my street cred. I blast that sh#! with my windows down when I drive to work to establish my bad-ass-ness. THUG LIFE!!!\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.   I CAN'T WAIT FOR FINDING DORY TO COME OUT!!!!!!!!!! JUST KEEP SWIMMING, JUST KEEP SWIMMING!!!!! \n\n\nI am a hardcore gansta",

                    "description": "THE BACKGROUND MUSIC IN THIS VIDEO BELONGS TO DISNEY, I DO NOT OWN IT. \nIf you can't watch the video where you live, try going here: https://vimeo.com/152353627\n\nMy sister, Staci, grew up obsessed with Disney's movie, The Little Mermaid, so I wanted to try to help her live out one of her childhood dreams of being a Mermaid...but finding a real mermaid hasn't been crossed off my TO-DO-LIST yet....and none of the nearby grocery stores or fish markets sell severed mermaid tails, at least not that I know of....SO, I had to improvise. \n\n(On a side note, I still plan on finding a real mermaid someday and naming her Ariel, unless of course she already has a name, that's cool too.)\n\nEither way, I will probably ask her out...unless she's a reverse mermaid, you know head/top half of fish with human legs...I still have plenty of time to figure this out.)\n\nANYWAYS, back to the Christmas thingy. I came up with an idea I thought would be cool. \n\nI had my sister, Brandi, help set up a room with stuffed animals of underwater creatures, with fake treasure/jewels scattered around, seashells, a bubble machine, and a cool light projection thingy that made the ceiling look like we were underwater. \n\nTHEN, I bought some fleecy, blanket, material stuffs and had Brandi sew a mermaid tail blanket thing for my other sister, Staci. (The sister this present was for).\n\nAfter everything was set up, I played a video on the T.V. with me convincingly dressed up as Ursula...or some male-version of Ursula...who still had parts of the female Ursula's \"Figure...\" (Clearly I have a gift for cosplay though, right?)  \n\nThe video started out with me kind of re-enacting the scene from The Little Mermaid, where Ursula convinces Ariel to become a human, but with me convincing her of the opposite, to become a mermaid.\n\nI ended up asking Staci (The gift-receiving Sister), to unwrap a present underneath the couch she was sitting on. (Which was covered in a giant blue blanket to represent the underwater-ness of the setting).\n\nIn the present was the mermaid blanket tail that Brandi had made (The Gift-Assisting Sister). Staci put on the mermaid tail and sang the part where Ariel goes \"Ah, Ah, Ahh, Ah, Ahh, Ahhh...\" \n(You know, the part in this video where my other Sister, Brandi, sang. That wasn't originally there, just added it for this video for additional randomness, hehe)\n\nAlso, while she was singing and slipping the mermaid tail on, I stood in front of her and started violently shaking a blanket in front of her (To represent the mermaid transformation process, obviously).  \n\nThe last part of the video was me trying an impression of Tiny Tim (R.I.P.), whom I am convinced, serenades you upon death as you descend into the sky (Or wherever your respective beliefs and/or preferences takes or doesn't  you.)\n\nAnyways, it was really fun to set up and embarrass myself in front of my family, which honestly is something I'm really good at. My family thought that I should further embarrass myself by posting the video on YouTube, so I did!! \nWell not all of it...but the ending...the whole thing was like 13 minutes or something...you can see more of it on Brandi's channel if you want, there is a slightly longer version on that one that I put up so my mom could share it with our relatives and stuff.\n\nFor those of you who watch my video or are subscribed to my channel, HEY!!! WHAT'S UP?!?!?! HOW WAS YOUR CHRISTMAHANNAKWANZIKAS AND/OR OTHER HOLIDAYS???? HOW MANY NEW YEARS RESOLUTIONS HAVE YOU ALREADY LOST??? I'M AT 12 SO FAR!!!! \n\nP.S. No, I did not film this underwater with my new GoPro camera, believe it or not, it was actually a Green Screen!! Crazy, right?? You probably had no idea that I was actually using a Green Screen, did you?? \n\nP.S.S. No, that wasn't my actual hair, believe it or not, those were actually wigs!!! Insane, right?? You probably had NO idea that those perfect condition wigs, that I toss in a box, were actually fake, did you??\n\nP.S.S.S. Actually, Brandi did something referred to as \"Combing,\" to that one red one out before filming the new scenes with me...this \"Combing,\" apparently involves running these spiky needles on a stick through the hair repeatedly. TECHNOLOGY!!!! \n\nP.S.S.S.S. No, I did not undergo breast augmentation before filming this video, believe it or not, those were actually volleyballs under my shirt!!! Wicked camera trick, eh???\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S. Yes, that was me singing...except for when my sister was singing...that was her singing....but anywhoo, the usual apologies for any pitchy-ness or whatever I may have messed up on. 99.9% of the time when I sing, it's when I'm alone...in the shower...or my car...you know, the usual stuff, mostly Britney Spears stuff to build up my street cred. I blast that sh#! with my windows down when I drive to work to establish my bad-ass-ness. THUG LIFE!!!\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.   I CAN'T WAIT FOR FINDING DORY TO COME OUT!!!!!!!!!! JUST KEEP SWIMMING, JUST KEEP SWIMMING!!!!! \n\n\nI am a hardcore gansta"

I still will make more impression videos, but this way, maybe I can upload more often...more oftener?? Oftenly??? Oftenerer????....considering I'm a Creative Writing major, I should probably know this....\nOh yeah, by the way, I messed up, that video of me and my \"band,\" was actually from 6 years ago, not 5. If you couldn't tell, I was the little girl on the drums. Man, I sure have grown up a lot in those last few decades. I've blossomed into a beautiful young lady, haven't I?? \nAlso, I will probably never ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, never, ever, ever , never try being the lead singer in any kind of scream-o band, because I pretty much lost my voice for a few days after we made that video, haha.

If you helped get my channel to 100,000 subscribers thank youuuuuuuu!!!!!!\nI might be making a new video soon to say thank you for 100,000 subs, so if you have any random questions or request you wanted me to answer or things you wanted me to try, just message me or leave it in the comments!!!\nThis is probably the most on topic video description thingy that I have ever written....which is weird, because I had my video get really off topic, it was originally just going to be the short intro and then the old videos of my \"band,\" but then I kind of got off topic when I was filming and talking into the camera, so I just kept all the extra stuff.\n\nP.S.

(By \"Sing,\" I mean making a random noises....one of the noises was a Shakira impression....if you can find it you win...something....shiny)\n\nOoh, by the way, I'm officially going as Snow White for Halloween...and by Snow White, I mean a Snow White whose dress is all torn up, covered in blood, with fangs and evil eyes who runs on all fours and uses her singing to lure helpless victims into the forest where she then feasts upon their souls....I may not be able to act out the last part.....\n\nIf you read all of this, Happy Halloween!!!!

                "description": "I'm kind of obsessed with everything Batman, so since I got a lot of requests to try more Batman impressions, I decided to make this video!!\nMost of the impressions were either requests I got from people or longer versions of impressions I did before that some people wanted me to make longer impressions of...and the rest were just random ones to make the video longer...I ended up making it too long again...hmm...probably those last two impressions, they lasted like 3 minutes together...so I guess that the length wasn't that bad then, right??...like 40 or 50 something in 5 minutes...wait, that would still be over 10 minutes if there were 100 impressions...blahhhh, this is hard\nSeriously though, when I make these videos, when I'm done picking the impressions I like the most, the video is like 20 minutes, so then I cut like half of it out and check the time and it's only down to like 19 minutes, so then I do the same thing again, and somehow it's up to 23 minutes long, so then I finally just delete 98% of the video and it ends up being like 8 minutes...stupid math...\nOH...for anyone who is subscribed to my channel or who watches my videos, I'm really sorry about taking so long to upload videos, I have this really bad habit of working on lots of stuff at once and not finishing things when I get close to finishing them...stupid brain...\nAnywhoo, sorry about that, I'm will try to force myself to finish new videos from now on and to not just focus on the impression videos!!!!!\nThe key word is focus...I don't focus well...it's against my religious beliefs, not really, but if I say that, then my boss at my job can't get mad at me when they tell me to focus and I zone out, I'm just like \"Oooh, see, Mrs. Boss lady, I'm not allowed to focus because it's against the rules of my religion and stuff...\"\nThen the boss lady will feel bad and say \"It's all good Joshua, you can just watch tv while I make Keira do all our work...stupid Keira...took the last cookie....actually she's kind of hot...\nSpeaking of hot, I don't like the hot, well not the super hot. Anything over 85 outside and I literally die. Literally, I drop dead as soon as I feel the heat. Literally. Happened twice this week. It's because my allergies get bad the hotter it is and then my asthma gets worse when the allergies get worse and then I can't breathe and then I die. Literally...\nSpeaking of soap, I used soap for that last Joker impression, well it was this face wash stuff, but it kind of sort of looked like the Joker when I put it on, so the \"Makeup,\" on that impression was soap.  \nSpeaking of ghosts, I watched this video a week ago, then this girl called my phone and left a voice message (I didn't feel like answering and I didn't recognize the number, you know what they say about that Stranger Danger stuff). The message she left just had her saying 7 days, and she left her number too just in case I needed to ask any questions, but I didn't call her back because I think she was trying to sell me something, that's why she said 7 days, that was like the opening to her selling something to me. Maybe some kind of trip like \"Seven days!!!...iiiiss how long you will be enjoying this completely free CRUISE to Salt Lake City, Utah!!!\"\nI do like Utah though...they have lots of snow and I like snow, so maybe I should call her back...oh wait, never mind, I deleted the message...oh yeah, but anyways, speaking of evil, malevolent, creepy ghost girls, there is this ghost girl climbing out of my tv right now, she's getting water all over the carpet...no worries, I turned the tv off...wait, she turned it back on, here she comes again...turned it off again...wait she turned it back on...ok just unplugged the tv...didn't work, tv is back on, soggy ghost girl still trying to crawl out of the tv...ok, fixed the problem, just threw the tv out the window, shattered into a lot of pieces",

                    "description": "I'm kind of obsessed with everything Batman, so since I got a lot of requests to try more Batman impressions, I decided to make this video!!\nMost of the impressions were either requests I got from people or longer versions of impressions I did before that some people wanted me to make longer impressions of...and the rest were just random ones to make the video longer...I ended up making it too long again...hmm...probably those last two impressions, they lasted like 3 minutes together...so I guess that the length wasn't that bad then, right??...like 40 or 50 something in 5 minutes...wait, that would still be over 10 minutes if there were 100 impressions...blahhhh, this is hard\nSeriously though, when I make these videos, when I'm done picking the impressions I like the most, the video is like 20 minutes, so then I cut like half of it out and check the time and it's only down to like 19 minutes, so then I do the same thing again, and somehow it's up to 23 minutes long, so then I finally just delete 98% of the video and it ends up being like 8 minutes...stupid math...\nOH...for anyone who is subscribed to my channel or who watches my videos, I'm really sorry about taking so long to upload videos, I have this really bad habit of working on lots of stuff at once and not finishing things when I get close to finishing them...stupid brain...\nAnywhoo, sorry about that, I'm will try to force myself to finish new videos from now on and to not just focus on the impression videos!!!!!\nThe key word is focus...I don't focus well...it's against my religious beliefs, not really, but if I say that, then my boss at my job can't get mad at me when they tell me to focus and I zone out, I'm just like \"Oooh, see, Mrs. Boss lady, I'm not allowed to focus because it's against the rules of my religion and stuff...\"\nThen the boss lady will feel bad and say \"It's all good Joshua, you can just watch tv while I make Keira do all our work...stupid Keira...took the last cookie....actually she's kind of hot...\nSpeaking of hot, I don't like the hot, well not the super hot. Anything over 85 outside and I literally die. Literally, I drop dead as soon as I feel the heat. Literally. Happened twice this week. It's because my allergies get bad the hotter it is and then my asthma gets worse when the allergies get worse and then I can't breathe and then I die. Literally...\nSpeaking of soap, I used soap for that last Joker impression, well it was this face wash stuff, but it kind of sort of looked like the Joker when I put it on, so the \"Makeup,\" on that impression was soap.  \nSpeaking of ghosts, I watched this video a week ago, then this girl called my phone and left a voice message (I didn't feel like answering and I didn't recognize the number, you know what they say about that Stranger Danger stuff). The message she left just had her saying 7 days, and she left her number too just in case I needed to ask any questions, but I didn't call her back because I think she was trying to sell me something, that's why she said 7 days, that was like the opening to her selling something to me. Maybe some kind of trip like \"Seven days!!!...iiiiss how long you will be enjoying this completely free CRUISE to Salt Lake City, Utah!!!\"\nI do like Utah though...they have lots of snow and I like snow, so maybe I should call her back...oh wait, never mind, I deleted the message...oh yeah, but anyways, speaking of evil, malevolent, creepy ghost girls, there is this ghost girl climbing out of my tv right now, she's getting water all over the carpet...no worries, I turned the tv off...wait, she turned it back on, here she comes again...turned it off again...wait she turned it back on...ok just unplugged the tv...didn't work, tv is back on, soggy ghost girl still trying to crawl out of the tv...ok, fixed the problem, just threw the tv out the window, shattered into a lot of pieces"

Ok, so the Lady Rainicorn impression...I tried using this translator app to write a sentence in Korean and then I listened to it and tried to say it while trying to sound like Lady Rainicorn, which means I was trying to sound like a girl, who speaks Korean, while trying to also speak Korean, which I don't know.....sooooooo if I said anything offensive by accident in Korean, I'm sorrrryyyyyy!!!! it wasn't my fault!!!!!! it was the translator thingys!!!!!!\n\nBut if you DO speak Korean, then write in the comments, what I actually said!!!...if I said anything, hehe\n\nI also didn't try an Ice King impression in this video because I want to actually practice that one, which is saying a lot about how much I like the Ice King since I literally never \"Practice,\" any of the impressions because I'm lazy but not really it's just my attention span, I probably couldn't focus long enou\n\n\nP.S. For anyone who actually watches my videos, sorry for not making videos that often, I PROMISE I am going to try to make them faster, I just have a crazy schedule, but I'm going to try making them faster now ^w^\nokay?\n\nP.S.S. Maybe Okay should be our always...hehehe, get it?? Like from TFIOS??...that movie has a lot of feels in it....  V_____V\nNo worries though, in my head, after the screen went black, the guy woke up and it turns out he was just in a coma, but now he's cured and so is Shailene Woodley, who btw apparently eats clay, has no house, makes her own food, and carries everything she owns in a rolling suitcase...and also is Divergent, so she's pretty much the Queen of all hippies/hipsters, but in a cool, non-crazy-celebrity type of way...plus she's cute, hehehehehe (giggle giggle)\n\nP.S.S.S. I feel like having a hippie phase now\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S. Someone asked me what would I do-OO-oo for a Klondike bar....well I've never had one...so I guess, I would maybe want to try one because the commercials are kind of funny and the song is catchy, so I guess I would pay $0.95 for a Klondike bar\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. How long does it take before you can tell if you have food poisoning??? I just made fish but I can't cook so i'm pretty sure i'm going to get food poisoning, plus I'm a little dizzy, but that might be from it being 4:56 am right now while I'm typing this, my sleep schedule is kind of messed up right now, hahahaha, I don't know why I'm laughing at that, my brain is in loopy lala land right now since it's late, it gets cray up in my bray bray (that's my brain), but luckily my family is going to Hawaii on Friday for a week, so i'm already on Hawaii's time, hehehehe...but yeah, I'll probably sleep in tomorrow until 3 pm....goodnight!!!!",

Ok, so the Lady Rainicorn impression...I tried using this translator app to write a sentence in Korean and then I listened to it and tried to say it while trying to sound like Lady Rainicorn, which means I was trying to sound like a girl, who speaks Korean, while trying to also speak Korean, which I don't know.....sooooooo if I said anything offensive by accident in Korean, I'm sorrrryyyyyy!!!! it wasn't my fault!!!!!! it was the translator thingys!!!!!!\n\nBut if you DO speak Korean, then write in the comments, what I actually said!!!...if I said anything, hehe\n\nI also didn't try an Ice King impression in this video because I want to actually practice that one, which is saying a lot about how much I like the Ice King since I literally never \"Practice,\" any of the impressions because I'm lazy but not really it's just my attention span, I probably couldn't focus long enou\n\n\nP.S. For anyone who actually watches my videos, sorry for not making videos that often, I PROMISE I am going to try to make them faster, I just have a crazy schedule, but I'm going to try making them faster now ^w^\nokay?\n\nP.S.S. Maybe Okay should be our always...hehehe, get it?? Like from TFIOS??...that movie has a lot of feels in it....

That's why, hehehe\n\nI also should probably take better care of those wigs. They look even frizzier than my hair, which is really frizzy right now since it's summer. I should probably get it cut.

I used that clip at the beginning of the video from my first 100 voice impressions video and in that first video I was coughing a lot, I was also coughing a lot in this one!!! Whoo!!! Thank you asthma!!! Oh and yeah, I wasn't dying, it's just this kind of asthma that makes me cough and lose my breathe a little when my allergies get bad and I had a sinus infection the week before making this so my voice was still a little shaky and stuff\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S. I really want to dress up like Quasimodo now and run around in public singing. I think he's part goat. Seriously, look up a video of him singing, I tried to sound like him but...(Duh, bro it's called an impression video)...I know it's an impression video but that doesn't meant it's a good impression (Well that's obvious) What's that supposed to mean!! (If it was a good impression then it would sound like him and not like a constipated goat) HEY!!!!...good burn bruh!!! (OMG, THANKS!!!! I just though of it myself!!) NO WAY!!!!

Probably not? IDK, maybe talking to a camera in your room, after kicking your family out of the house for a while is a normal thing? I guess it's better than someone in their 20's talking to imaginary friends, right? Hahaha (btw, if any of my imaginary friends are reading this, I wasn't being serious)\n\nIf you have any other impression requests, just leave them in the comments I need help making a new list!!\nOr an idea for an impression video, like Nintendo/Harry Potter/Adventure Time/Nickelodeon/Cartoon Network and like that persons comment, so I can see if there is one that has like 4 likes and then maybe do it\n\nP.S.

It takes a CRAZY amount of time to edit these videos with all the picture and words, so if I messed up...again...and accidently skipped a number or anything, sorry...It's also hard to count after 10, when you don't have any fingers left over, you know what I mean? Right? Right? Yeah...totes\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.  A.D.D. thought...why do Unicorns have that horn? I mean, what does it really do? Is it why they can fly? Or is it just for magic powers and stuff. And what happens if it falls off? Do they turn into a horse? Or a donkey? Or do they stop being able to fly/use magic powers? There should be a job for people who study this stuff, it's important\n\n\nOK BYE.....",

I don't mind my imaginary friends or the dead people I see hearing me, but I've got some serious issues with having people hear me, mostly just because I think I suck.\nBut I tried it just because some of you have been so nice and asked to hear my normal singing voice...at least I think that's my normal singing voice...honestly I don't even know what my normal talking or singing voices sound like anymore because I like talking in different voices so much.......\n\nOH yeah, if you notice my shirt changing, it's because some of the impressions were from other impression videos I made and the rest I had to make in two days because I had sinusitis (stupid allergies) and I was coughing a lot...again...it's ok though I didn't die, unless you want me to, in which case, I'm sorry I disappointed you.\n\nP.S. Sorry I also suck at guitar\n\nP.S.S. I think I sound like a chubby chipmunk when I speed my voice up\n\nP.S.S.S. Sorry to anyone who watches my videos but wants me to make more videos than I do, I have a lot of ideas for other types of videos, so I will try making more soon. Unless I get hit by lightning an die, then I won't because I would probably be dead...but not really, because I'm immune to lightning. (I've been electrocuted by those outlet thingys about 238 times.)\nI'm surprised I don't have electric superpowers or something. That would be cool. Except I live in a save neighborhood, so there isn't any crime to fights. I guess I could always help people get cats out of trees or volunteer at retirement homes and help the elderly peoples with stuff, but then I would have to get a costume and everything and I don't know how to sew or make clothes and I can't just take Spiderman or Batman's costumes, that's copyright, they would sew me...sue me...\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S. I hear this one girl tried to sue McDonalds because she spilled coffee on her lap and it was hot and the cup didn't say anywhere on it that it was hot. \n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. I have no idea how I ended up talking about McDonalds.....\n\nBa da da da da, it's food\n\nOk, bye",

I don't mind my imaginary friends or the dead people I see hearing me, but I've got some serious issues with having people hear me, mostly just because I think I suck.\nBut I tried it just because some of you have been so nice and asked to hear my normal singing voice...at least I think that's my normal singing voice...honestly I don't even know what my normal talking or singing voices sound like anymore because I like talking in different voices so much.......\n\nOH yeah, if you notice my shirt changing, it's because some of the impressions were from other impression videos I made and the rest I had to make in two days because I had sinusitis (stupid allergies) and I was coughing a lot...again...it's ok though I didn't die, unless you want me to, in which case, I'm sorry I disappointed you.\n\nP.S. Sorry I also suck at guitar\n\nP.S.S. I think I sound like a chubby chipmunk when I speed my voice up\n\nP.S.S.S. Sorry to anyone who watches my videos but wants me to make more videos than I do, I have a lot of ideas for other types of videos, so I will try making more soon. Unless I get hit by lightning an die, then I won't because I would probably be dead...but not really, because I'm immune to lightning. (I've been electrocuted by those outlet thingys about 238 times.)\nI'm surprised I don't have electric superpowers or something. That would be cool. Except I live in a save neighborhood, so there isn't any crime to fights. I guess I could always help people get cats out of trees or volunteer at retirement homes and help the elderly peoples with stuff, but then I would have to get a costume and everything and I don't know how to sew or make clothes and I can't just take Spiderman or Batman's costumes, that's copyright, they would sew me...sue me...\n\nP.S.S.S.S.S. I hear this one girl tried to sue McDonalds because she spilled coffee on her lap and it was hot and the cup didn't say anywhere on it that it was hot. \n\nP.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.S. I have no idea how I ended up talking about McDonalds.....\n\nBa da da da da, it's food\n\nOk, bye"

After making this video, I would have tried 202 Pok\u00e9mon voice impressions and I think that is the most on YouTube...that's pretty cool isn't it? I'm pretty swaggie now...swag? swagadelic? swagalishish? swagsome?.....\n\nP.S.S.

Now that I think of it, someone who has enough time to try 202 Pok\u00e9mon voice impressions probably doesn't have much of a social life...hmm..... \n\nI'm not a nerd though...right? I mean, collecting Pok\u00e9mon plushes, toys, games, playing the games in college, and spending a few hours making a video where I try over 200 voice impressions of them doesn't make me a nerd....\n\nOK, I'm a Pokenerd...hehehehe\n\n^__^\n\nbt dubs I'm going to start making more videos soon. I just FINALLY finished another list of 100 random voice impressions, soooooo I will try that soon AND I also wanted to make other random videos.....\n\nIf anyone reads this far, then I only have one word to say...Konichiwa",

                    "description": "Some of you were asking why some Pokemon weren't in my first Pok\u00e9mon impressions video, sooooooooo I made another one\n\nThe first 101 though were the 101 that I could remember what they sounded like the best and I could only remember like half of these, so I'm sorry if they don't sound anything like what they are supposed to at all\nI just made up random noises or guessed what those ones sounded like, hehe\n\nP.S. After making this video, I would have tried 202 Pok\u00e9mon voice impressions and I think that is the most on YouTube...that's pretty cool isn't it? I'm pretty swaggie now...swag? swagadelic? swagalishish? swagsome?.....\n\nP.S.S. Sorry about me trying to act cool and saying swag, I probably just killed that word for you...if you're read that far\n\nP.S.S.S. Now that I think of it, someone who has enough time to try 202 Pok\u00e9mon voice impressions probably doesn't have much of a social life...hmm..... \n\nI'm not a nerd though...right? I mean, collecting Pok\u00e9mon plushes, toys, games, playing the games in college, and spending a few hours making a video where I try over 200 voice impressions of them doesn't make me a nerd....\n\nOK, I'm a Pokenerd...hehehehe\n\n^__^\n\nbt dubs I'm going to start making more videos soon. I just FINALLY finished another list of 100 random voice impressions, soooooo I will try that soon AND I also wanted to make other random videos.....\n\nIf anyone reads this far, then I only have one word to say...Konichiwa"
